This is a problem.  Also when I click compose new email I don't get a choice [again it uses the default all the time].

Of course this means you need a functioning phone in each vehicle but you would probably want that anyway. The phone need not be that advanced, it would just need to be running a recent version of Android and have GPS. The Tasker app only costs a few dollars.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> Here is a set of Tasker profiles that allow for an intermittent update of the handset's location. It needs two profiles because currently Tasker doesn't have a \"get location fix\" type call, so this can be achieved instead by activating a location-based profile. </p>\n\n<p><em>Note that this profile works for me, but I'm quite new to Tasker so it may not be the optimal approach. If anyone knows a better way to do any part of it then please comment on this answer.</em></p>\n\n<p>The first profile is location based and gets the GPS fix. The second profile is timer based and activates the first, then waits for a while before posting the details.</p>\n\n<p>To create the first profile open Tasker and:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>At the main menu select <strong>New</strong>-><strong>Location</strong>, then <strong>Done</strong>.</li>\n<li>At the <strong>Name Context</strong> dialog, enter <strong>Location</strong>, then press <strong>OK*</strong>.</li>\n<li>At the <strong>Task Edit</strong> screen, select the <strong>+</strong> icon, then <strong>Variable</strong> then <strong>Variable Set</strong>.</li>\n<li>In the <strong>Variable Set</strong> screen, set <strong>Name</strong>=**%LOC_TIMESTAMP** and <strong>To</strong> to <strong>%DATE</strong>, then press <strong>Done</strong>.</li>\n<li>Press <strong>Done</strong> again to return to the main Tasker screen.</li>\n<li>We actually want the LOC_TIMESTAMPto be set when the profile exits, so tap on the <strong>Variable Set ...</strong> item on the right and select <strong>Move To Exit</strong> to make it an exit event.</li>\n<li>We don't want this profile to be active, so tap on the <strong>Location</strong> flag, then in the <strong>Context Options</strong> dialog, select <strong>Profile</strong> then <strong>Disable</strong>.</li>\n<li>The profile needs to have a name to be used by other profiles, so long-tap on the profile's header bar then in the <strong>Profile Options</strong> dialog, select <strong>Name</strong>, then in the <strong>Name Profile</strong> dialog enter <strong>Current Location</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You now have a profile that will get a location fix when activated and set the LOC_TIMESTAMP variable to the date when the profile was deactivated. This gives a pretty accurate record of the last location fix.</p>\n\n<p>We now need another profile to periodically activate the <strong>Current Location</strong> profile and send the data somewhere:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>From the main Tasker screen, select <strong>New</strong>-><strong>Time</strong>.</li>\n<li>In the dialog set <strong>From:</strong> to <strong>9:00</strong> and To: to <strong>17:00</strong> (assuming you only want to track 9-5, if you want to have this active constantly, uncheck both the <strong>From:</strong> and <strong>To:</strong> fields). Check <strong>Repeat:</strong> and set the value to <strong>30 Minute(s)</strong>.</li>\n<li>In the <strong>Task Edit:</strong> screen we need to add 3 tasks:\n<ul>\n<li>First make note of the current GPS status so we can turn it off when done if needed:\n<ul>\n<li>Select <strong>+</strong>-><strong>Variable</strong>-><strong>Variable Set</strong>.</li>\n<li>Set <strong>Name</strong> to <strong>%WASGPS</strong> and <strong>To</strong> to <strong>%GPS%</strong>.</li>\n<li>Select Done.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Second turn GPS on if it is off:\n<ul>\n<li>Select <strong>+</strong>-><strong>Misc</strong>-><strong>GPS</strong>.</li>\n<li>In the <strong>GPS</strong> dialog set <strong>Set</strong> to <strong>On</strong>.</li>\n<li>Check <strong>If</strong> then in the three fields enter the respective values <strong>%WASGPS</strong>, <strong>~</strong> (equals), and <strong>Off</strong></li>\n<li>Select <strong>Done</strong>.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Third enable the <strong>Current Location</strong> profile:\n<ul>\n<li>Select <strong>+</strong>-><strong>Tasker</strong>-><strong>Profile Status</strong>.</li>\n<li>In the <strong>Profile Status</strong> dialog, long-click in the <strong>Name</strong> field, select the <strong>Current Location</strong> profile from the <strong>Select Profile</strong> list (this is why it needs to be named).</li>\n<li>Set the <strong>Set</strong> field to <strong>On</strong>.</li>\n<li>Select <strong>Done</strong>.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Select <strong>Done</strong> to return to the main Tasker screen.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We now need to add some exit actions to the new profile.

However you can fully utilize the device without getting a single book from them.  All the additional formats can come from anywhere, and be loaded onto the device via the USB cable.  Yes it's not as convienent as being able to download them over the air, but loading up on books before you go isn't too much of a hassle.  B&amp;N also distributes free content as well, visiting an actual B&amp;N with your Nook unlocks special coupons and free content (anything from ebooks to even food in the cafe).  Free samples of books can be downloaded over the air so you can test a book out before you pay for it (or download it elsewhere).</p>\n\n<p>I've had a Nook since launch and I've been very happy with it, I've used it from reading B&amp;N books, to PDF's of text to even powerpoint slides (converted to PDF).

(I use the word \"worthwhile\" because manufacturers can produce high-power zooms with tiny lenses, but the quality of the pictures is going to suffer dearly.) Because the lenses are bigger, they take up more space in the camera body. In the camera world, bigger really is better (when it comes to picture quality.)</p>\n\n<p>Also, with manual focus control, you need something to grip onto and that sort of requires that the lens be handled by one's hand. The idea of a P&amp;S is to do just that, not fiddle around with manual focus. So it's hard to find a manufacturer willing to make a P&amp;S camera that allows you to manually turn the lens to focus it.</p>\n\n<p>So in order for your wife to get these 2 features (better zoom and good manual control), she's going to have to start looking at cameras with larger bodies. They don't have to be ridiculously large, but I imagine she probably has a super slim P&amp;S that can slip into a small hand purse.</p>\n\n<p>As an example, I have <a href=\"http://www.neocamera.com/review_canon_a710.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this old Canon A710 P&amp;S camera</a>. It's not super slim, but it's not fat either. (aka, it might take up most of a hand purse, but it would fit fine in a larger pocketbook.)</p>\n\n<p>It has a medium sized lens for a P&amp;S, has a 6x zoom, and image stabilization. It can also switch into manual focus, although it needs to be controlled via the buttons on the back. You cannot turn the lens by hand.</p>\n\n<p>If she wanted to turn the lens by hand to focus, there are still cameras that are technically P&amp;S style, but are much bigger. They don't have interchangeable lenses like SLR cameras, either. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IKLJU0\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ35</a> is an example of this. And it's affordable at $300, but it's bulky. Not SLR bulky, but it's still on the big side.</p>\n\n<p>My best recommendation is to make a list of all the important things she wants in a camera and then really prioritize that list in a few categories, like Mandatory, Important, and Nice, but Not That Important.</p>\n\n<p>This will make it easier to figure out what she really wants and when/where you can compromise.</p>\n\n<p>Good luck!</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 750, "LastActivityDate": "2010-08-17T17:40:12.090"}

A deliberate full discharge and recharge every 30 charges corrects this problem. Letting the battery run down to the cut-off point in the equipment will do this. If ignored, the fuel gauge will become increasingly less accurate. [...] The worst condition is keeping a fully charged battery at elevated temperatures, which is the case with running laptop batteries. If used on main power, the battery inside a laptop will only last for 12-18 months. [...] Removing the battery from the laptop when running on fixed power protects the battery from heat.  [...] Avoid frequent full discharges because this puts additional strain on the battery. Several partial discharges with frequent recharges are better for lithium-ion than one deep one. Recharging a partially charged lithium-ion does not cause harm because there is no memory. (In this respect, lithium-ion differs from nickel-based batteries.) Short battery life in a laptop is mainly cause by heat rather than charge / discharge patterns. [...] Consider removing the battery from a laptop when running on fixed power.

Most devices prevent deep discharge by shutting down well before this threshold is met so it isn't normally something to worry about.

At that stage you actually have more usable charge capacity from the battery kept at 70% and the difference will become really significant over the next year.

Over time manufacturers worked out that they could do shortcuts like saving the satellite data, and then saving the last known time and position in the device's memory,  and then compare the signals received with that to speed things up. This has the drawback that it only speeds things up if you're in roughly the same part of the world as when you last switched it on, but you do at least have the satellite data so don't have to wait around for that.</p>\n\n<p>Smartphones often use a shortcut to get the first fix, where they'll use some other method to get your rough location. Typically either by identifying which cell towers are in range, and then looking these up over the internet on a database of known cell tower positions, or by scanning for WiFi networks in the area, and looking the SSIDs of these up ona database over the internet. It's this step of identifying cell phone towers or WiFi that needs the internet connection to connect to the database that matches the ID to a physical location.</p>\n\n<p>The advantage that standalone GPS receivers have is that all their hardware and software is dedicated to and optimised for GPS use, they have just one radio antenna, that can be as big as needed to receive weaker signals, they have just one signal processor that is optimised to process GPS signals, their software is optimised for just getting GPS fixes and displaying maps. This means that the GPS device should be able to pick up weaker signals, so be able to see more satellites, so get a faster fix with less assistance.</p>\n\n<p>Whereas on a smartphone the GPS is a second-class citizen forced to work alongside a whole load of other gear. Typical phones need to pick up (and transmit) radio signals for GSM, GPRS, HSDPA/3G, Bluetooth, FM Radio, WiFi and GPS. There will be multiple radio antennas for these (of which the ones for voice and data will be probably be given the favoured locations and space) and the software is more general purpose, and any tuning and optimising will be aligned to voice and data, as they're the ones people really complain about when their signal gets dropped. What this adds up to is that the GPS antenna in a phone can normally only pick up stronger signals, not weak ones, so sees less satellites at one time, so needs more help to get a fast fix.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 171, "LastActivityDate": "2010-09-06T12:41:10.967", "CommentCount": 2}
