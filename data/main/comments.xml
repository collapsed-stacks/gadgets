Plus your paying 200$ for a pen and worry about 25$ writing blocks? That's like worrying about gas for your Porsche ;-)" CreationDate="2010-09-14T06:18:13.957" UserId="5" />
  <row Id="1446" PostId="1866" Text="what about services that say they only use HSPA (ie. wind mobile - see my list of service providers above)?  I assume that's for both voice and data then?  In this case, does it matter if my phone is gsm or cdma?  " CreationDate="2010-09-14T12:55:39.377" UserId="690" />
  <row Id="1447" PostId="1821" Text="It only matters in the sense that HSPA cannot natively talk on CDMA or GSM networks without a radio in the phone for those technologies too. Which is why most all phones have only CDMA or one of the other ones. So you need to look at coverage in your area, places you would expect to travel to, and think about if you would be traveling internationally and then decide which technology best supports your needs. For me that would not be GSM or HSPA as their coverage in the Midwest of the USA sucks. Which is primarily where I travel and live." CreationDate="2010-09-14T12:58:02.283" UserId="904" />
  <row Id="1453" PostId="1866" Text="You're best off asking the provider. They will be able to tell you. If you get clueless tech support, find someone with a phone on that service." CreationDate="2010-09-14T18:01:46.713" UserId="185" />
  <row Id="1456" PostId="1812" Text="I'd try local first, tasker is cheaper and more powerful, but no where near as user friendly. That is Android of course. Both will let you change things based on time, location, plugged in, etc. I have my phone get quiet if it is plugged in, at home, and when I am usually asleep, a bit louder if I am at work, any time, and full loud the rest of the time. Very handy." CreationDate="2010-09-14T22:27:56.940" UserId="20" />
