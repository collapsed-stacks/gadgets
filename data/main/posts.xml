Similar to a thermostat, the two metals expand at a different rate, causing the strip to bend.  When it closed a circuit, it caused the toast to pop.  The problem is that, after the first batch, the heat in the system cannot be dumped immediately, so subsequent batches will vary in doneness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today, better toasters will use an actual timer so they are much more consistent.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, for what it's worth, this would be extremely difficult to solve using most forms of detection.  Different materials will toast at different rates, with different effects.  Purely from a color perspective, wheat bread is already more brown than white so you might get only half-toasted wheat bread if adjusted properly for white.

I currently have a Blackberry Bold 9000 that I enjoy for the most part but I have one main issue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The issue is email.  I use a single Gmail account that aggregates around 10 email addresses that all forward to it and I have my Gmail account setup to be able to send email as each of those individual accounts.  This all works great through the web interface.  They all come into the inbox, I can reply to any email and it auto uses the address the email was sent to and if I click compose I have a drop down of &quot;from&quot; addresses to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The problem is the online experience isn't translating over.  While I receive email fine and it always has the &quot;to&quot; address properly set so I know who they are trying to contact when I reply using BIS/BES it sends from the default email account that I set on gmail.com.  This is a problem.  Also when I click compose new email I don't get a choice [again it uses the default all the time].  I've also tried dicking around with the gmail app but that also has no dropdown &quot;from&quot; in the compose message form.  If I go to gmail.com I can select the from field but that's a huge pain and the blackberry browser is awful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main question here is do the iPhone or Android handle this problem better?  I would imagine Android would but don't have any close friends who are Android users.  Another thing I like about the Blackberry is how there's a nice unified inbox for all email [both this single gmail account as well as a few other IMAP accounts from work, etc], SMS &amp;amp; MMS, Twitter, etc.  So part 2 of the question is can I have a unified inbox that handles gmail well?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="513" LastActivityDate="2010-08-16T12:54:30.943" Title="What is a good phone choice for someone who uses Gmail to manage multiple email addresses" Tags="&lt;mobile-phones&gt;&lt;email&gt;" AnswerCount="5" />

Of course this means you need a functioning phone in each vehicle but you would probably want that anyway. The phone need not be that advanced, it would just need to be running a recent version of Android and have GPS. The Tasker app only costs a few dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; Here is a set of Tasker profiles that allow for an intermittent update of the handset's location. It needs two profiles because currently Tasker doesn't have a &quot;get location fix&quot; type call, so this can be achieved instead by activating a location-based profile. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note that this profile works for me, but I'm quite new to Tasker so it may not be the optimal approach. If anyone knows a better way to do any part of it then please comment on this answer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first profile is location based and gets the GPS fix. The second profile is timer based and activates the first, then waits for a while before posting the details.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To create the first profile open Tasker and:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;At the main menu select &lt;strong&gt;New&lt;/strong&gt;-&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location&lt;/strong&gt;, then &lt;strong&gt;Done&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;At the &lt;strong&gt;Name Context&lt;/strong&gt; dialog, enter &lt;strong&gt;Location&lt;/strong&gt;, then press &lt;strong&gt;OK*&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;At the &lt;strong&gt;Task Edit&lt;/strong&gt; screen, select the &lt;strong&gt;+&lt;/strong&gt; icon, then &lt;strong&gt;Variable&lt;/strong&gt; then &lt;strong&gt;Variable Set&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In the &lt;strong&gt;Variable Set&lt;/strong&gt; screen, set &lt;strong&gt;Name&lt;/strong&gt;=**%LOC_TIMESTAMP** and &lt;strong&gt;To&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;%DATE&lt;/strong&gt;, then press &lt;strong&gt;Done&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Press &lt;strong&gt;Done&lt;/strong&gt; again to return to the main Tasker screen.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;We actually want the LOC_TIMESTAMPto be set when the profile exits, so tap on the &lt;strong&gt;Variable Set ...&lt;/strong&gt; item on the right and select &lt;strong&gt;Move To Exit&lt;/strong&gt; to make it an exit event.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;We don't want this profile to be active, so tap on the &lt;strong&gt;Location&lt;/strong&gt; flag, then in the &lt;strong&gt;Context Options&lt;/strong&gt; dialog, select &lt;strong&gt;Profile&lt;/strong&gt; then &lt;strong&gt;Disable&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The profile needs to have a name to be used by other profiles, so long-tap on the profile's header bar then in the &lt;strong&gt;Profile Options&lt;/strong&gt; dialog, select &lt;strong&gt;Name&lt;/strong&gt;, then in the &lt;strong&gt;Name Profile&lt;/strong&gt; dialog enter &lt;strong&gt;Current Location&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You now have a profile that will get a location fix when activated and set the LOC_TIMESTAMP variable to the date when the profile was deactivated.

From either the Barnes and Noble store, Fictionwise, or most other sources.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;DRM - Yes, B&amp;amp;N books have DRM, just like Amazon.  However you can fully utilize the device without getting a single book from them.  All the additional formats can come from anywhere, and be loaded onto the device via the USB cable.  Yes it's not as convienent as being able to download them over the air, but loading up on books before you go isn't too much of a hassle.  B&amp;amp;N also distributes free content as well, visiting an actual B&amp;amp;N with your Nook unlocks special coupons and free content (anything from ebooks to even food in the cafe).  Free samples of books can be downloaded over the air so you can test a book out before you pay for it (or download it elsewhere).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've had a Nook since launch and I've been very happy with it, I've used it from reading B&amp;amp;N books, to PDF's of text to even powerpoint slides (converted to PDF).

(I use the word &quot;worthwhile&quot; because manufacturers can produce high-power zooms with tiny lenses, but the quality of the pictures is going to suffer dearly.) Because the lenses are bigger, they take up more space in the camera body. In the camera world, bigger really is better (when it comes to picture quality.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, with manual focus control, you need something to grip onto and that sort of requires that the lens be handled by one's hand. The idea of a P&amp;amp;S is to do just that, not fiddle around with manual focus. So it's hard to find a manufacturer willing to make a P&amp;amp;S camera that allows you to manually turn the lens to focus it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So in order for your wife to get these 2 features (better zoom and good manual control), she's going to have to start looking at cameras with larger bodies. They don't have to be ridiculously large, but I imagine she probably has a super slim P&amp;amp;S that can slip into a small hand purse.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As an example, I have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.neocamera.com/review_canon_a710.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this old Canon A710 P&amp;amp;S camera&lt;/a&gt;. It's not super slim, but it's not fat either. (aka, it might take up most of a hand purse, but it would fit fine in a larger pocketbook.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It has a medium sized lens for a P&amp;amp;S, has a 6x zoom, and image stabilization. It can also switch into manual focus, although it needs to be controlled via the buttons on the back. You cannot turn the lens by hand.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If she wanted to turn the lens by hand to focus, there are still cameras that are technically P&amp;amp;S style, but are much bigger. They don't have interchangeable lenses like SLR cameras, either. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IKLJU0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ35&lt;/a&gt; is an example of this. And it's affordable at $300, but it's bulky. Not SLR bulky, but it's still on the big side.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My best recommendation is to make a list of all the important things she wants in a camera and then really prioritize that list in a few categories, like Mandatory, Important, and Nice, but Not That Important.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This will make it easier to figure out what she really wants and when/where you can compromise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="750" LastActivityDate="2010-08-17T17:40:12.090" />

Keeping a battery at full charge all the time actually reduces its capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response to comments:&lt;/strong&gt;  I concede that discarging is not significant when dealing with Li-Ion batteries, which we may assume a modern device as the HTC HD2 uses. &lt;em&gt;Nevertheless, keeping it on external power all the time is not good.&lt;/em&gt; For the curious, here is some background which provides arguments to both sides:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Short discharges with subsequent recharges do not provide the periodic calibration needed to synchronize the fuel gauge with the battery's state-of-charge. A deliberate full discharge and recharge every 30 charges corrects this problem. Letting the battery run down to the cut-off point in the equipment will do this. If ignored, the fuel gauge will become increasingly less accurate. [...] The worst condition is keeping a fully charged battery at elevated temperatures, which is the case with running laptop batteries. If used on main power, the battery inside a laptop will only last for 12-18 months. [...] Removing the battery from the laptop when running on fixed power protects the battery from heat.  [...] Avoid frequent full discharges because this puts additional strain on the battery. Several partial discharges with frequent recharges are better for lithium-ion than one deep one. Recharging a partially charged lithium-ion does not cause harm because there is no memory. (In this respect, lithium-ion differs from nickel-based batteries.) Short battery life in a laptop is mainly cause by heat rather than charge / discharge patterns. [...] Consider removing the battery from a laptop when running on fixed power.

For example:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lead-acid batteries (think: car starter or electric scooter) can be &quot;de-sulfated&quot; thru a special charge/discharge cycle which typically restores much of the battery's original capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ni-cd batteries can lose some of their capacity if they aren't fully discharged every once in a while. Performing a deep discharge can potentially restore capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ni-MH and Li-ion batteries don't really exhibit the drastic/sudden capacity loss like Ni-cds and lead-acids, but (like all batteries) will slowly lose capacity over time as the electrolyte wears out thru repeated use. Ergo, no real &quot;conditioning&quot; can be performed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In fact, Li-ion batteries start losing capacity as soon as they roll off the assembly line and will continue to lose capacity slowly over time, whether they are being used or not. To counter-act this effect, it is recommended that a Li-ion battery be kept cool and if being stored for a long time, kept at a 40% charge.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The only advantage of fully discharging a Li-ion battery could be to recalibrate a smart charger (like on your laptop) -- by fully discharging the battery, it gives the charge controller an opportunity to monitor how much power was used to recharge the battery and thus calculate the current max. capacity of the battery. This gives a better estimate of runtime, but doesn't improve the capacity any...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;More info about batteries can be read about at: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.batteryuniversity.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.batteryuniversity.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So to answer your question: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;yes, Lead-acids and NiCds can be reconditioned to an extent, but eventually they will wear out completely and no amount of reconditioning will fix them. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;no, NiMHs and Li-ions typically cannot be reconditioned. Once they're worn out, they're dead.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please recycle! :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="750" LastActivityDate="2010-08-25T16:33:05.247" CommentCount="1" />

Most devices prevent deep discharge by shutting down well before this threshold is met so it isn't normally something to worry about. Coming close to this level wont degrade the battery a such so running your phone until the battery goes flat every so often isn't a major problem - but leaving it fully discharged (but not deep discharged) for any significant length of time is risky as it will degrade and might become unusable as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The best strategy for keeping Li-Ion batteries in good condition for as long as possible is to keep the device as cool as you can at all times and don't fully charge the battery if you're not going to need that charge immediately. Trickle charging that keeps them close to 100% for extended periods of time is not optimal. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;e.g. If your battery has a 1200mAh rating when manufactured then after a year the fully charged capacity of a battery left at 100% continually would have degraded to 780mAh while one kept at 70% would only degrade to 1150mAh. At that stage you actually have more usable charge capacity from the battery kept at 70% and the difference will become really significant over the next year. Typically a Li-ion battery that spends most of it's time fully charged and relatively warm has almost no charge capacity after 3 years. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="961" LastActivityDate="2010-08-29T01:21:17.657" />

Over time manufacturers worked out that they could do shortcuts like saving the satellite data, and then saving the last known time and position in the device's memory,  and then compare the signals received with that to speed things up. This has the drawback that it only speeds things up if you're in roughly the same part of the world as when you last switched it on, but you do at least have the satellite data so don't have to wait around for that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Smartphones often use a shortcut to get the first fix, where they'll use some other method to get your rough location. Typically either by identifying which cell towers are in range, and then looking these up over the internet on a database of known cell tower positions, or by scanning for WiFi networks in the area, and looking the SSIDs of these up ona database over the internet. It's this step of identifying cell phone towers or WiFi that needs the internet connection to connect to the database that matches the ID to a physical location.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The advantage that standalone GPS receivers have is that all their hardware and software is dedicated to and optimised for GPS use, they have just one radio antenna, that can be as big as needed to receive weaker signals, they have just one signal processor that is optimised to process GPS signals, their software is optimised for just getting GPS fixes and displaying maps. This means that the GPS device should be able to pick up weaker signals, so be able to see more satellites, so get a faster fix with less assistance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whereas on a smartphone the GPS is a second-class citizen forced to work alongside a whole load of other gear. Typical phones need to pick up (and transmit) radio signals for GSM, GPRS, HSDPA/3G, Bluetooth, FM Radio, WiFi and GPS. There will be multiple radio antennas for these (of which the ones for voice and data will be probably be given the favoured locations and space) and the software is more general purpose, and any tuning and optimising will be aligned to voice and data, as they're the ones people really complain about when their signal gets dropped. What this adds up to is that the GPS antenna in a phone can normally only pick up stronger signals, not weak ones, so sees less satellites at one time, so needs more help to get a fast fix.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="171" LastActivityDate="2010-09-06T12:41:10.967" CommentCount="2" />

Projectors are getting smaller and more efficient, not larger and uglier. 2) While the one projector could have some new technology in it, I have never heard of a project having 2000 lumens or more and getting more than 2000 hrs of bulb use (let alone 6-8000 as the one states). Unless I've missed a leap in technology few projectors under $2000 will get anywhere near that performance. I can say that based on practical real world experience and having helped order projectors for multiple IT offices.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;3) There is no brand name mentioned anywhere.

Is it then correct to say that Wind (etc) is using &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; HSPA for voice and data?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm asking because I'm looking at buying a new phone on Ebay/craigslist etc and I wasn't sure if I should get GSM,CDMA,HSPA etc etc...

Research the different phones and come up with a list of 3 or 4 that have everything you want. Also do research on the carrier to make sure you have coverage where you want it. Then pull the lever and buy one. This way you get the best of both worlds. If you need it to work internationally then I would hands down recommend GSM.
