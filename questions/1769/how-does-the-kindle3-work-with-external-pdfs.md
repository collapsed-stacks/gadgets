<p>Hello,</p>

<p>I have alot of PDFs on my computer and I am planning to buy a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002Y27P3M/ref=kindlesu-1" rel="nofollow">kindle 3</a>. My question is: </p>

<p>How can I transfer my PDFs to the kindle? Will I be charged something or will I have to send that file to some email address?</p>

<p>Is there no way I can drag and drop files from my computer to the Kindle by connecting it to my PC (USB)?</p>

<p>What happens if I try to run a PDF (which is not licensed) on Kindle3?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Assuming the 3 behaves the same as the DX, you can</p>

<ul>
<li>Plug your Kindle into your computer. It appears as a USB disk. Drag-and-drop PDFs manually, or set up some automated syncing (folder actions on OS X).</li>
<li>Email it to yourself (there will be a small charge for each file)</li>
</ul>

<p>What do you mean by "not licensed"? Normal PDFs (no password required for viewing) appear as normal PDFs that you can view just fine.</p>
