<p>My TMobile Blackberry 9700 Bold, and previously Blackberry 8320 Curve support UMA from TMobile.  This is an interesting service that allows you to connect to a WiFi Access point and pretend you are on a cellular network.  In other words, calls, SMS, email etc, all use the WiFi.  </p>

<p>For me this is great for when I visit my parents in Toronto, and I can make US calls from their house, using UMA over their WiFi.</p>

<p>However, I find that it suddenly stopes working for no apparent reason and I get a plethora of different error codes.  Most often that it cannot get the DNS name of the UMA server.  But of course I can.  </p>

<p>I find I need to reboot the router to get it working.  This issue has happened through my Dlink 614+ router and Buffalo NFiniti new router.  </p>

<p>Anyway, I was wondering if there was a list of the various error codes, with their meanings, and possible resolutions. </p>

<p>I had same issues with my UMA on same phone. I have since switched to a Netgear WNDR3700 and connection has been very stable since.</p>
