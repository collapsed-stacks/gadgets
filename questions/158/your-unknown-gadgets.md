<p>Do you own a gadget that you use regularly but that most people have never heard of?
Can you make a case that every fellow geek should get the gadget as well?</p>

<p>Timex Ironman Datalink USB watch.  Has a USB port on the watch, only has 32K of RAM, and programs need to be written in Assembler, to fit in a 900 byte (yes BYTE!) execution space.  </p>

<p>One of the developers recently figured out a way to break the 900 bytes barrier, leading to bigger apps.</p>

<p>It can sync to the computer, load software on it.  </p>

<p>I bought it since it has a 200 lap stopwatch and I can download my splits from it!  But the rest of the features are GREAT!  </p>

<p>I got a <a href="http://blog.theg2.net/2009/04/who-needs-100-mouse-you-do.html" rel="nofollow">"$100" Logitech mouse</a> for Christmas a few years ago that has 11 buttons, and quite honestly I can't think of using a standard 3 or 5 button mouse ever again. I ended up buying a second mouse about a year later to use on another computer. Definitely a must have.</p>
