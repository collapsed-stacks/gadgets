<p>My cell phone has an option to display an ERI banner, but provides no information on what that is.  What is it; what information does it show?  Disabling it doesn't change anything that I've yet been able to detect.</p>

<p>On my old phone, there was a similar thing, but it was just called "banner". If it's the same thing, all it does is display the name of the network you are currently using on the main screen (on your phone, it might be somewhere else, but it's usually visible). Normally, it will show your carrier, unless you are roaming, then it will show the network that you are roaming onto.</p>
