<p>We are researching e-readers for my wife and I, as well as for a gift for a family member, and are trying to figure out which e-ink based e-reader is most consumer friendly.</p>

<p>By consumer friendly, I mean least-intrusive/annoying DRM mechanisms.  Buying a book that is locked to a certain e-reader leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  For example, it is my understanding that books purchased from Amazon for the Kindle will not be readable on other e-readers (and vice versa? Please educate me if I am wrong).  I know that Amazon has developed software for other devices (iPhone, PC, etc) for reading their books, but, you're still tied to Amazon and their software/readers.</p>

<p>Being able to temporarily lend books to another account (such as my wifes, or other family member) is a big bonus.</p>

<p>Another very big bonus - e-readers that support common digital library formats (such as from Overdrive).</p>

<p>Am I asking too much? Is this industry still to young to have adopted strong standards for cross-reader compatibilities?</p>

<p>I'm surprised that this hasn't been said but the <strong>Nook</strong></p>

<p>I'll be specific on why:</p>

<p>Book Lending - This was one of the major selling points of the Nook, some (not all, they are however denoted with a logo) can be loaned to another person using the B&amp;N reader (on any platform).  This is only for a limited time, but if the borrower is actually going to read the book, it's enough time for them to get through it.</p>

<p>Other formats - Like I mentioned before, there are a number of formats that the Nook accepts: EPUB (Non or Adobe DRM), PDB (Non DRM), PDF.  From either the Barnes and Noble store, Fictionwise, or most other sources.</p>

<p>DRM - Yes, B&amp;N books have DRM, just like Amazon.  However you can fully utilize the device without getting a single book from them.  All the additional formats can come from anywhere, and be loaded onto the device via the USB cable.  Yes it's not as convienent as being able to download them over the air, but loading up on books before you go isn't too much of a hassle.  B&amp;N also distributes free content as well, visiting an actual B&amp;N with your Nook unlocks special coupons and free content (anything from ebooks to even food in the cafe).  Free samples of books can be downloaded over the air so you can test a book out before you pay for it (or download it elsewhere).</p>

<p>I've had a Nook since launch and I've been very happy with it, I've used it from reading B&amp;N books, to PDF's of text to even powerpoint slides (converted to PDF).  While sometimes it takes some fiddling to get what you want, it's never that complicated and usually is straightforward.</p>

<p>I think that the Sony Reader is the common answer to this kind of question.  Supports many formats, including several DRM-free formats, and the ability to check out library books.</p>

<p>My vote for Sony Reader too. But I recommend do not take model with touchscreen, because it makes screen brightness lower.</p>

<p>In other side, the best e-reader is smartphone :-) With my android-based phone I can read any popular books: epub, awz (Amazon Kindle with Kindle software) and so on. Of course it is not e-ink, so eyes should get tired after some time.</p>
