<p>I've decided to buy a Kindle, just don't know which model to go for. Is the functionality of the sharing and annotations features crippled on a wifi-only model, or does it do a good job of syncing info from these features for offline use and saving your own tweets etc. for next time you go online?</p>

<p>NB. by sharing I mean posting quotes to Facebook/Twitter etc, not swapping books.</p>
