<p>I own a HTC Desire and drain the battery really easily. So I thought I'd try some portable charger for when I'm out camping and have no power, or when I'm out and about with no power source available all day.</p>

<p>I have two Philips portable chargers (SCE4430/10), bought the second one because I though the first one was broken. As it turns out, they have the same bad behaviour. When the phone is finished charging, the portable charger and the phone start to really quickly drain each other's batteries. So when I try to charge my phone overnight, I'm left with and even LESS charge than I had when I started charging.</p>

<p>Somewhere I read that this was because the charger was delivering only a 350mA charge. So I had a look around and found a beautiful charger by Proporta. It delivers a "whopping" 700mA, so I should have been good to go.  It even looks like the Proporta charger cuts off when the phone is full, the blinking lights will go out as soon as my phone reaches a 100% charge. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, I see the same behaviour, they end up draining each other (though it's not as bad as with the Philips ones).</p>

<p>Does anybody know why this draining is occurring? But most of all, who can recommend a GOOD portable charger (it doesn't have to be super cheap!) for when I go camping again in a few weeks? </p>

<p>I've used the <a href="http://www.igo.com/" rel="nofollow">iGo</a> series of chargers for a while, if you get phones or have gadgets that don't charge over USB. The A32 tip actually shorts the data pins so phones that are finicky when charging over Mini-USB will charge correctly.</p>

<p>The charger is of the idea you buy one wall wart, and change the tips out when you get new devices. The charger draws very little 'phantom' power when not connected.</p>

<p>Don't get the iPod Shuffle charger (the one that has a USB-A female port) and expect it to put out USB standard current, though. It only puts out enough to charge an iPod shuffle.</p>

<p>(Editorial: making their charger output standard USB current to a USB Female A port would allow you to plug a device's included USB cable into their charger when they would rather you buy more tips. This would destroy their business model.)</p>

<p>Woot.com has a special today on the <a href="http://woot.com" rel="nofollow">Energizer Universal 8000mAh Portable Battery Pack</a>. I can't personally recommend it, but it <em>sounds</em> good.</p>

<p>Have look at this <a href="http://www.skillett.com/technology/charging-on-the-move-pines-usb-rechargeable-backup-battery-pack/" rel="nofollow">PINES USB Pack Review</a>. I have not tried it with a HTC desire but it says it is a <em>4800mAh Li-Ion battery that extends up to 16 hours of talk time (based on mobile phone with 850mAh battery)</em> so should work.</p>
