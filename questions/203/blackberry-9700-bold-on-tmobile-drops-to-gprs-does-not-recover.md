<p>My BB 9700 Bold on TMobile US will drop down in the middle of a call from 3G to EDGE and return as I drive through different regions.  But if it drops down to GPRS, then it stays in GPRS and does not get out of it until I drop the call. </p>

<p>The problem is TMobile is hitting me for roaming charges while I drive I-80 through New Jersey and talk on the phone.  It is getting really annoying and expensive. </p>

<p>Is there anything I can do about it?</p>
