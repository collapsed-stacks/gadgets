<p>I recently dropped my Desire in a bowl of soup (cue the laughter..) and of course it broke. I've completely disassembled it and cleaned all of the parts with alcohol. It now works again, except for the middle button with the "optic trackball" in it and the volume down button.</p>

<p>The optic eye doesn't seem to get any input any more and pushing it doesn't have any effect on the selection. Whenever I get the volume down button to work, it gets stuck so it goes into vibrate mode and will not stop vibrating. But by pressing the middle button I can sometimes get it to stop and quickly get the volume back up again.</p>

<p>From what I can tell, the middle button and the volume buttons are connected to the same board, so I was hoping I could just replace that board and get my phone to work again.</p>

<p>So, long introduction to a simple question: does anybody know where I can order this part?</p>
