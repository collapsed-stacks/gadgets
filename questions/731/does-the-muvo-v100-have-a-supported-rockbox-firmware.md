<p>I'm seriously hoping to upgrade the firmware on my Creative MuVo v100 player.</p>

<p>Is RockBox available for it? I couldn't seem to find anything, but I'm hoping I'm wrong.</p>

<p>No, Rockbox is not available for the MuVo.</p>

<p>On <a href="http://www.rockbox.org/wiki/TargetStatus#New_Platforms_Currently_Under_De" rel="nofollow">Rockbox Status on Various Targets</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>No Creative player is listed as "supported".</p></li>
<li><p>Only Creative ZVM is listed "Under Development".</p></li>
<li><p>Under "Pre-Development Ports" ("hunting and gathering stage. These devices have no code written for them. Usually more firmware and hardware disassembly are needed to gather enough information to begin actually working on these ports. ") 4 Creative players are listed: <strong>Creative ZEN</strong>, <strong>Creative Zen Touch</strong>, <strong>Creative Zen V Plus/Non-Plus</strong>, and <strong>Creative Zen Nano Plus/Non-Plus</strong>. The last one uses the same chipset as the MuVo.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The most detailed information is on <a href="http://www.rockbox.org/wiki/SigmaTelSTMP3xxx" rel="nofollow">SigmaTel STMP3xxx series</a> where Creative MuVo is listed under "STMP35xx series", as a STMP3520 based device.</p>
