<p>I do lots of writing and sketching in paper notebooks. I want a digital version with the portability of an iPad that I could write on with a stylus. Tablet PCs are too heavy and expensive, and have insufficient battery life. Wacom Bamboo tablets are not portable since they need to be attached to a PC; I want to be able to write on the couch, bed, meetings, etc.</p>

<p>It doesn't need to be a full portable computer; I'm just looking for something I can take and store notes with, and maybe transfer them to other devices. Does such a device exist?</p>

<p>Since you mentioned the iPad, here's a nifty trick</p>

<p><a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-19512_7-10443415-233.html" rel="nofollow">Here's your iPad stylus</a></p>

<p>Gives you the benifits of a stylus (for a very reasonable price), and all the functionality of the iPad.  Haven't tried it myself but the reviews I've read seemed pretty pleased.</p>
