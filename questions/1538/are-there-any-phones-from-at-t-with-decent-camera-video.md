<p>Currently, I own the <a href="http://www.wireless.att.com/answer-center/main.jsp?t=solutionTab&amp;solutionId=KB97047" rel="nofollow">Pantech Matrix C740</a>. Great phone, it's compact, and I like to feel actual typing for both number pad and keyboard.</p>

<p>However, the camera leaves much to be desired - the quality is pretty bad unless the picture is taken in 100% ideal lighting. Anything less and photos and video become nigh impossible to see. Processing is also pretty slow when it comes to browsing a photo album or something.</p>

<p>I'd like to upgrade my phone to something maybe a little faster and definitely with a better camera. Tangibility is important to me; it should have a keyboard at the very least, so iPhones need not apply. If it has a (flash)light, that's a huge bonus. </p>

<p>Are there any products that fit the bill?</p>
