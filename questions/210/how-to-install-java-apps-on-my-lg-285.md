<p>Is there any way to enable Java applications to be installed on an LG 285?</p>

<p>Trying to install them by using a .JAD over-the-air results in an "Access denied" message.</p>

<p>Is there a way to manually install them or enable OTA installations?</p>

<p>My provider is Telus, by the way.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I know that it can be done, because up until recently, I could install them - I got Google Maps and Opera Mini working flawlessly.</p>
