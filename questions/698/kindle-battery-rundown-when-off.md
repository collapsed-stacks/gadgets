<p>Here's what appears to happen to me:</p>

<ol>
<li>turn off wireless</li>
<li>'turn off' kindle</li>
<li>set it aside for 3 days</li>
<li>find it in 'battery is dead, you must plug it in' state.</li>
</ol>

<p>It's a nearly new kindle, and this is not the experience I see reported by others. Any ideas? is there no way to really turn a kindle off?</p>

<p>First make sure battery is fully charged - repeat few full charge / discharge cycles. If you switch off WiFi, Kindle has about same energy consumption whether it is on or off - as the eInk screen uses energy only for redrawing.  The battery will eventually self discharge whether you use it or not.</p>

<p>I did measurement with Sony PRS 500 (no Wifi, eInk screen) and maximum battery life when not used was about 14-18 days, less with use. 3 days is rather extreme.  </p>
