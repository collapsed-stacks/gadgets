<p>Now that the new Kindle is coming out that is cheaper with Wi-Fi only, I am wondering if the next Kindle DX will have this option too.  And, if it will be cheaper.</p>

<p>Any information out there on the plans for the Kindle DX?</p>

<p>Amazon currently has not announced any plans on releasing a WiFi-only DX.</p>

<p>They only list 3 available for order/preorder. Kindle, Kindle WiFi only, DX.</p>
