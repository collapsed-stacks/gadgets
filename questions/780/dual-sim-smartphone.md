<p>Samsung has a brand of dual-sim phones, where two sim cards can be used at the same time. This means that they are both active at the same time, you can be called at anytime on both and when you call you simply select which number to use.</p>

<p>Lots of people have two phone numbers, one for professional use and one for personal use. However, carrying two phones is pretty stupid and cumbersome.</p>

<p>Does anyone knows if any manufacturer plans to build dual-sim smartphones, preferably with Windows Mobile (7?).</p>

<p><a href="http://wmpoweruser.com/dual-sim-dual-active-standby-gigabyte-gsmart-s1205-reviewed/" rel="nofollow">The Gigabyte GSmart S1205</a>  is the closest thing I saw. It has WinMo 6.5, but maybe will be upgradable to Windows Phone 7(?).</p>

<p>There are a few different dual-sim WinMo phones that pop up from a Google search, but I didn't see any plans for a Windows Phone 7 one. </p>
