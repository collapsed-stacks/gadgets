<p>If its a local file the easiest way to share is to upload it to YouTube and then give people the link to share. Just go to YouTube.com, create an account, and then upload the video. Or you can use Box.net, create a free account, upload the file, and then give people the link to view.</p>

<p>If the video is already online, with very few exceptions, almost all videos now have a "Share" or "link" button or direct video link of some kind. Just click that button and copy the link or if you are given the direct link, just copy that and give it out to whomever.</p>
