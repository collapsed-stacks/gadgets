<p>I have a home theater setup where I have my PC in my living room with my HDTV + PS3. In normal situations I have my PC connected to my monitor and Comcast/PS3 connected to my HDTV. So both screens are used concurrently with different content.</p>

<p>Sometimes I wish to broadcast video from my PC to my HDTV (that isn't compatible with PS3 to just play over lan x264/h264 I'm looking at you Sony). However to achieve this I need to unplug my computer from my monitor and plug it into my HDTV. Rather inconvenient. I'd much rather have a receiver that I connect all of my electronics into  and flip these around with a remote. So last night I did some comparisons on receivers but then realized I don't think any of these would solve my problem since in normal circumstances I don't want to dedicate my receiver to just connecting my computer to my monitor.</p>

<p>Are there receivers that can handle this? </p>
