<p>My car has a blue-tooth phone interface that works perfectly with my blackberry for using my car's speakers as a speakerphone. </p>

<p>I'd like to be able to play my mp3 files on the blackberry over the car speakers, but unfortunately the car only supports the phone interface. Is there an app or a hack to play music over the phone interface from a blackberry? </p>

<p>If it matters, it is a Blackberry 8830</p>

<p>Your headset would need to be able to support the profile requested, and the Blackberry firmware would also as well.</p>

<p>I've used a Linux laptop to send music to a mono bluetooth headset that only supports the headset profile, so it's certainly POSSIBLE (the music didn't sound so hot, I assume it was downsampled to 11khz or lower) but it would depend on whether RIM has decided to let you do this.</p>

<p>I would test your Car's bluetooth phone interface by pairing it with a laptop. It's fairly easy to do this with a laptop; took me 5 minutes w/ an Ubuntu install, but anything that has  PulseAudio and BlueZ installed should do.</p>

<p>If you can get the laptop to work, then the problem is with your Blackberry.</p>
