<p>I just bought a Kindle and a ton of books for the vacation. But because I expect to jump in the pool every so often and I can no longer use my hardcover bookmarks, I need to know how to add a bookmark to a page on my Kindle.</p>

<p>So where's the bookmark option hidden?</p>

<p>I don't know about you, but if I'm reading a book on the kindle and hit the menu button, there's an 'Add a bookmark' menu item right there.</p>

<p>Alt-B or Press the "Menu" key and select the "Add Bookmark" option.</p>
