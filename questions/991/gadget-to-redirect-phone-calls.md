<p>I'm looking for something (a machine, gadget, etc.) that my company can use to call people in different countries without incurring in International rates.</p>

<p>We have a VoIP network that connects all our sites. From my office we would like to call numbers that are in countries where we have offices. </p>

<p>I was thinking of something like, we call a number in our office where we have a machine connected that would ask us for a local number to dial. We provide that number and the machine simply patch us through.</p>

<p>Is this possible?</p>

<p>Depending on what countries you're looking to call, <a href="http://www.vonage.com/residential_calling_plans/compare_plans.php?refer_id=WEBHO0706010001W&amp;lid=main_nav_calling_plans" rel="nofollow">Vonage</a> has a couple of plans that include international calling to several countries.  This would just be the normal rate, so you wouldn't have to pay additional charges to those countries.</p>

<p>The other alternative is of course <a href="http://www.skype.com" rel="nofollow">Skype</a> which would require you to install it on computers at your sites, but would be completly free.</p>
