<p>I like the headphones that came with my phone (Nexus One) and I like iPhone headphones but a) I can't buy the Nexus One headphones anywhere and b) the iPhone ones are $30. Are there any other headphone out there with controls on the wire and a mic that are as durable as the above but cheaper?</p>

<p>I have the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Creative-EP-630i-Isolating-Headphones-iPhone/dp/B002EL4MY8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=electronics&amp;qid=1282122741&amp;sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">Creative EP-630i</a> which work great with my HTC Hero. I'd expect you won't get a lot cheaper without getting crappy quality. </p>

<p>I recommend the Nokia Bluetooth Headsets. I bought a pair for listing to music while working out and did research. Most BT headsets have poor audio quality, but the Nokia faired well. After purchasing and using I can't tell the difference between my earbuds or the Nokia. </p>

<p>It has a built in mic for phones calls. Once paired you can listen to music and then use the button on the headset to answer a call when it comes in. The battery is rechargeable and seems to last a long time for me. I have had it connected to an iPod and three different Android phones as well as my PS3.</p>

<p>The cost was around $60 but worth every penny. I wouldn't recommend going cheap if audio quality is important.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.zagg.com/audio/smart-buds.php" rel="nofollow">ZAGGsmartbuds</a> are pretty good. I recently bought one and sound quality is pretty decent and the cords are wrapped with invisibleSHIELD which is pretty awesome. It has a mic, a button which works the same way as iPhone earphones' call/voice control/play/pause/skip button, and it's got a volume slider. Note that volume slide doesn't change volume on the device but it just changes volume on the wire. I actually like this because the lowest volume on my iPhone is still pretty loud with in-ear type of earphones. ZAGGsmartbuds are in-ear type by the way.</p>

<p>It's $49.99, but if you sign up for <a href="http://www.zagg.com/community/contest.php" rel="nofollow">weekly iPad giveaway</a> they send you 30-50% off discount code. I bought mine with 50% off code. You might also have luck <a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=zagg%20discount%2050%25" rel="nofollow">searching on Twitter for 50% off code</a>. </p>

<p>That's $24.99 decent sound quality and very durable earphones.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
