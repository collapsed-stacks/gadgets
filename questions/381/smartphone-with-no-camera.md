<p>The <a href="http://mobile.softpedia.com/phones/Nokia/Nokia-E51-no-camera.shtml" rel="nofollow">Nokia E51</a> is available without a camera.<br>
The AT&amp;T Tilt is available without a camera: look for model 8900 instead of 8925.<br>
Blackberry has many models without cameras: 8800, 8820, 8830, and 9650 are ones that I've seen.</p>

<p>Depending on your phone, you might be able to open it up and remove the camera. Some models have the camera connected to the main PC board via a flexible cable.</p>
