<p>I am looking for a suggested gsm cellphone to purchase that is:</p>

<ul>
<li>available used readily</li>
<li>gsm, unlocked.</li>
<li>has gps</li>
<li>generally favorably reviewed or you have owned one and liked it.</li>
<li>runs Windows Mobile 6.x (6.5 is latest in the 6 series right?)</li>
<li>has a large amount of shareware or commercial apps for it.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have my doubts about that last one, as it seems Windows Mobile is a bit of a third-place platform. Nevertheless, my intent is to get one and learn a bit of Windows Mobile .net development and use the device as a target device.</p>
