<p>Hi Guys,</p>

<p>I have noticed these two cheap models of projects on eBay. They don't seem to have any brand or model number. Is any of you familiar with them?</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://cgi.ebay.com.au/HD-1080P-LCD-PROJECTOR-SUPPORTS-HDMI-PS3-WII-XBOX-TV-PC-/180539333369?pt=AU_Home_Theatre&amp;hash=item2a08fb9af9#ht_9045wt_1231" rel="nofollow">Model 1</a></li>
<li><a href="http://cgi.ebay.com.au/NEW-HD-1080i-HOME-THEATRE-HDMI-Projector-TV-WII-PS3-/180520497025?pt=AU_Home_Theatre&amp;hash=item2a07dc2f81#ht_4968wt_837" rel="nofollow">Model 2</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I'd like to find out their names so I can look-up tests and reviews.
The numbers look fairly good but I'd like to find out more (in particular, how noisy they might be).</p>

<p>Any help appreciated.</p>

<p>I've worked in IT for almost 10 years now and do not recognize the design of either projector. Don't get me wrong, there are probably models out there I do not and never would recognize. These projectors seem to be knock offs though. </p>

<p>A couple giveaways 1) the boxiness and size. Projectors are getting smaller and more efficient, not larger and uglier. 2) While the one projector could have some new technology in it, I have never heard of a project having 2000 lumens or more and getting more than 2000 hrs of bulb use (let alone 6-8000 as the one states). Unless I've missed a leap in technology few projectors under $2000 will get anywhere near that performance. I can say that based on practical real world experience and having helped order projectors for multiple IT offices.</p>

<p>3) There is no brand name mentioned anywhere. If the projector was sold under a reputable brand name you can be sure the person listing the item would mention it. Everyone knows brand name sells products. If it is not obvious what the brand is, or it is not listed then chances are it is a knock off brand and the seller is trying to wow you into buying something.</p>

<p>Like Momma always said, "If it looks to good to be true it probably is"!</p>
