<p>Having bought a lot of tech stuff during these years, the best devices I've enjoyed the most are the ones upgradable with open-source firmwares.<br>
To name some of these:</p>

<ul>
<li>Two <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox" rel="nofollow">Xbox</a> (first version) with <a href="http://www.xbmc.org" rel="nofollow">Xbmc</a></li>
<li>Nokia <a href="http://www.sat-receiver-world.com/media/images/digsat_nokia_9500_thb.jpg" rel="nofollow">MediaMaster 9500</a> with <a href="http://www.dvb2000.org/dvb2000/index.htm" rel="nofollow">Dvb 2000</a>   </li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Portable" rel="nofollow">Sony PSP</a> with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Portable_homebrew" rel="nofollow">CFW</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Could you recommend any other devices that can be upgraded with open-source firmwares?</p>

<p>What type of devices are you looking to upgrade with open source firmware? Once we know what you are looking for it might be easier to point you in the right direction.</p>

<p>The hottest devices right now to get open source firmware are probably smartphones and <a href="http://www.rockbox.org/" rel="nofollow">MP3 players</a> due to their market growth. There is also some work being done on the <a href="http://nookdevs.com/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">Nook since it uses Android based firmware</a>. As well, I suppose I should add, anything that runs off of Android firmware.</p>

<p><a href="http://netzke.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">PS3 just recently got hacked and you can use almost any USB device to hack it</a>.</p>

<p>People have figured out how to hack some GPS devices and put open source maps on them, but the functionality is weak and makes the device pretty useless because of how much complexity is created.</p>
