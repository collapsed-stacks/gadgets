<p>I have a vonage phone adapter. I wish to use the settings from this adapter on my gizmo project software to create a soft phone. Is there any body who has done this?</p>

<p>This will let me use gizmo project to make calls via Vonage.</p>

<p>Some of kind of guide to SIP settings would help, I suppose.</p>
