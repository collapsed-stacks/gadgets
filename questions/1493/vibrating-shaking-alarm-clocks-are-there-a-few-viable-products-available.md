<p>I have trouble hearing alarm clocks and would like an alternative solution.</p>

<p>I was given a freebie vibrating alarm clock by my doctor; it can go under or next to a pillow, but even that I have difficulty waking up to and it's also very limited in quality.</p>

<p>I wear a shirt with a pocket at night and put the alarm clock in it (it's about the size of two-and-a-half decks of playing cards) and put a piece of tape over it so it stays in the pocket.  This actually works pretty well to wake me up, but it is a pain to setup every night and is not the most comfortable solution.</p>

<p>I would like a small (credit card or smaller length x width and pencil or smaller thickness) device that I can put on my shirt, pillow, or wherever as long as it is powerful enough to wake me up.</p>

<p>I have seen various devices for sale online, but they don't seem to be quite what I'm looking for.  The closest I have found is the "ShakAwake" at <a href="http://www.shakeawake.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.shakeawake.com/</a>.  Have you used an alarm like this, or do you know of any on the market that actually work?</p>
