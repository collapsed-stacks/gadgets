<p>The Palm support site says that USB sync doesn't work with Windows 7 and I don't have a bluetooth device. What can I do?</p>

<p>Besides try to convince Palm to create new drivers, you can either buy a cheap usb bluetooth devive, or use Windows XP mode.</p>

<p>I gave up trying to sync my Palm TX because it just wasn't worth it for me, but this forum has some people who were able to sync their T3 - <a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itprovirt/thread/01ee8887-b2d9-4001-bcfd-c4e0579d3aa1" rel="nofollow">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itprovirt/thread/01ee8887-b2d9-4001-bcfd-c4e0579d3aa1</a></p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
