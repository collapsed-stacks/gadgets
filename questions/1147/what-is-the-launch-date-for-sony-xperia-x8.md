<p>According to <a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/sony_ericsson_xperia_x8-3403.php" rel="nofollow">GSMArena</a> and <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/06/16/sony-ericssons-3-inch-xperia-x8-made-official-coming-in-q3-201/" rel="nofollow">Engadget</a>, the expected release date is Quarter 3, 2010.</p>

<p>So expect it to be released real soon.</p>
