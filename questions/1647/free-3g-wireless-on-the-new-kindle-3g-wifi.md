<p>The Kindle gets 3G wireless access. Which means that you can use the Kindle store to buy books, and sync your bookmarks with your account, and you can use the Kindle's built-in browser, but that's pretty much it. Since the built-in wireless functions are pretty limited, the thing doesn't use much data bandwidth, so it doesn't cost Amazon much to maintain the access. They make it back (in theory) by selling you more books over time.</p>
