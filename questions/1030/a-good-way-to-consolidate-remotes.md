<p>I have the following: </p>

<ul>
<li>Sharp 42' flat screen TV</li>
<li>Generic Scientific Atlanta Explorer 8300HD DVR (given to my by Time Warner Cable)</li>
<li>PS3</li>
<li>Nintendo Wii</li>
<li>iPod Cradle</li>
</ul>

<p>I am trying to escape the million remotes insanity by consolidating them into, hopefully, one.   In particular, having to switch TV sources is maddening. </p>

<p>I don't mean to play PS3 or Wii games with this remote, but I'd like to be able to use the consoles' multimedia functions with this remote.  </p>

<p>I've heard about Logitech Harmony, but I don't know anyone that has it, so I can't see how it works in practice.  Plus they have a massive multitude of remotes from $99 to $399.</p>

<p>Any suggestions?  Logitech or otherwise.</p>

<p>I'm a big fan of my Harmony remote. I've got one of the low-end ones (the 620). It handles pretty much any IR device without much trouble-the programming software knows about most home theater equipment. </p>

<p>The downside is that 'IR' - if you want to control the PS3, it looks like you'll need an <a href="http://www.logitech.com/en-us/remotes/universal-remotes/devices/5732" rel="nofollow">adapter</a> they make as well as the remote. As for the Wii - you're just out of luck. The Wii user interface is almost completely setup to use point and click via the Wiimote. So any remote that tried to run a Wii would pretty much have to incorporate all of the functionality of a Wiimote. </p>

<p>The only media thing I use the Wii for right now is Netflix (I stream MP3 via a Squeezebox), so for me this isn't a big deal. I suspect there's very little that you can do with the Wii that you can't do with the PS3, so I bet you could live with a solution like this.</p>

<p>I have a <a href="http://www.remotecentral.com/reviews/urc_r50/index.html" rel="nofollow">URC-R50</a> that I really like Universal Remote Control is the brand name. It is fairy easy to setup.  You can either select a device from its database, or get it to learn commands from an existing remote.  Its all hard buttons, but has a programmable LCD display for 6 of them.  Its IR only, so won't work with the PS3 (without an adaptor), or the Wii.  I use it to control my TVs, stereo, DVD player, Squeeze Box, and probably some other stuff I can't remember.  </p>

<p>If you have an iphone, ipod or ipad you could also try the <a href="http://thinkflood.com/products/redeye-mini/" rel="nofollow" title="redeye mini">Redeye Mini</a> - it seems to have positive reviews from what I have read.  Also mentioned on engadget if you search for it, sorry can't post more links yet!</p>
