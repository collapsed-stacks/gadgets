<p>We have a cottage in Muskoka, with 10 cottages on one property.  We still have a 4 party party line in ours,  (Yes!  They cannot legally take it away from us, thank you CRTC!  So our phone billl is crazy cheap) so we cannot get DSL, and Cable is not an option for us.  (No cable runs out our way!) </p>

<p>So one of our neighbors got DSL and has the crappy Sympatico WAP, and we need a longer range one, so we can see it at our cottage,  about 200 feet away.  </p>

<p>What WAP has the best long distance performance?  Wireless G would be preferred, since we have more G devices than N, but for most we could live with N if we had too. </p>

<p>I don't have experience with a ton of WAPs, but I did purchase and install 3 <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16833162134&amp;cm_re=WHR-HP-G54-_-33-162-134-_-Product" rel="nofollow">Buffalo WHR-HP-G54</a> routers in the motel I work at. I chose this particular model because it had a large, powerful external antenna, and because I could install DD-WRT, which let me increase the transmit power to boost the signal even more.</p>

<p>During installation I decided to test the range of one of the units and was able to get a strong signal on the opposite end of the motel, 350' away; granted, I was using my MacBook for testing which, too, had a strong wireless card, but it's considerably stronger than most other off-the-shelf routers, and is probably sufficient for your needs. And the flexibility of being able to install firmwares like DD-WRT and Tomato is a big bonus, too.</p>
