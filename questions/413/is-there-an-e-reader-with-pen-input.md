<p>I'm looking for a notebook in the traditional sense.  Something which will allow me to read academic papers (so PDF and maybe epub) and also take good recognizable notes on it.</p>

<p>Is there actually something like that out there?  I'm not worried about size (in fact, the bigger the better, within reasonable limitations.)</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>The readers from IREX (http://irextechnologies.com/) have pen input and let you annotate PDFs. </p>

<p>IREX were one of the first to make an e-paper reader (the Iliad) but haven't been as successful in marketing their devices as some of the other manufacturers like Sony. It's a shame as I have an Iliad and it's a very good device with some great features (such as the pen input and WiFi) but let down by poor power management.</p>
