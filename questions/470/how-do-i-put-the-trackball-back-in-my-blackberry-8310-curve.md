<p>The little trackball and its associated gubbins (plastic and metal retaining clips, little spinning magnets) has all just decided it's going to fall out. I have collected up all the bits, but I cannot find a way of getting them all back in to the hole and keeping them there (they keep falling back out).</p>

<p>It is possible to repair this easily or is now the time to get a new one?</p>

<p>The plastic retaining ring is supposed to be rotated to lock it in place.</p>
