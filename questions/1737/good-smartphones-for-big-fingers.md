<p>Can anyone recommend a good smartphone for someone with thick, slightly arthritic fingers?</p>

<p>Wanting something for reading ebooks and/or webbrowsing on the commute.</p>

<p>Or should someone with these attributes simply avoid the smartphone concept and get two devices: a simpler phone and some kind of netbook or ebook reader?</p>

<p>If you have big fingers, you'll want a big phone so the buttons on the screen are easier to hit more accurately and precisely. My suggestion would therefore be one of the following, depending on your carrier:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.droiddoes.com/#/droidx/featured/overview" rel="nofollow">Motorola Droid X</a> (4.3" Android, Verizon)</li>
<li><a href="http://now.sprint.com/firsts/evo4g/" rel="nofollow">HTC Evo 4G</a> (4.3" Android, Sprint)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.t-mobile.com/shop/phones/Cell-Phone-Detail.aspx?cell-phone=HTC-HD2" rel="nofollow">HTC HD2</a> (4.3", Windows Mobile, T-Mobile)</li>

</ul>

<p>Personally, I couldn't be happier with my iPhone 4. The new high resolution display makes reading on the devise very enjoyable and less strain on the eyes. Also, I would say that the iPhone web browser makes it easy to zoom in on small links to tap on with big fingers. Anything with a touch screen has the advantage of changing the button size over a physical keyboard which is limitted by the size of the devise. Also, I assume that pressing physical buttons may cause more strain than the highly sensitive touch screen of the iPhone. There may be other comparable touch screen smart phones, but the iPhone 4 high resolution display is like nothing I have ever seen. It's much easier on the eyes than other standard digital display. I would recommend trying one out to see how you like it.</p>
