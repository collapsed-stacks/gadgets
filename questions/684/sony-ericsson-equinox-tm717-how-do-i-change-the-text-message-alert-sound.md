<p>Just wondering if there is any easy way? Or even if there is a hard way (using a2uploader, Ive acquired access to the root file system.... and lots of things are binary files...)</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.sonyericsson.com/cws/download/1/655/970/1252405922/TM717__UG_AE.PDF" rel="nofollow">the manual</a>, you <em>may</em> be able to change the alert tone. It is a bit ambiguous whether you can actually do so, and I don't have this phone to confirm or otherwise if you actually can. This is the relevant section with my emphasis in italics:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Message options</strong><br>
  You can set some options, <em>such as the
  Message alert</em> and default storage
  location, to apply to all messages. You
  can set other options, such as the
  Delivery priority and Delivery time, for
  each message you send.<br>
  <strong>To set options for all messages</strong></p>
  
  <p>1 Select <strong>Menu</strong> > <strong>Messaging</strong> > <strong>Messages</strong> > <strong>Settings</strong>.<br>
  2 Select an option.</p>
</blockquote>
