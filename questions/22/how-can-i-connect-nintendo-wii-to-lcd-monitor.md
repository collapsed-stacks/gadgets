<p>What you need is a component video to VGA converter box. They are a little pricey, though.</p>

<p>One of many examples:

<p>Here's a cheaper option whose source is composite video rather than component. The quality will not be as good but it's far cheaper:

<p>The best option that I found yet, is to use a component that called <a href="http://www.neoya.com/shop/wii2hdmi/" rel="nofollow">wii2hdmi</a>. The price seems to be reasonable so, (in comparison to converter box), and in addition I need to get a HDMI cable and audio cable.</p>

<p>I didn't tried it out yet, so I don't know how much it's actually good, but it seems to me the best solution.</p>
