<p>My Sony Ericsson Xperia 10 already has some scratches on the touchscreen display. Is there a recommended way to remove those scratches?</p>

<p>I don't think you can actually REMOVE scratches from anything. There are a few products to help reduce the visibility of them by cleaning the screen. I think the best product would be LCD wipes. I have used alcohol before as well, but this may not work on all screens. If it's glass, Windex will even work. I'm not familiar with the Xperia, so I can't tell you which is best, these are just a few options.</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>
