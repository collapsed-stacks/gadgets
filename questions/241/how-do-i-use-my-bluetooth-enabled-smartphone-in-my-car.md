<p>I have a new car kit. Nokia CK 100. I was wondering if I can use my smartphone not just as a phone, but to listen music somehow?</p>

<p>Your smartphone should support the A2DP protocol for streaming music over bluetooth. Have a look at <a href="http://nds1.nokia.com/phones/files/guides/Nokia_CarKit_CK-100_UG_and_IG_en.pdf" rel="nofollow">page 8 of the user manual</a> to learn how to pair the two devices.</p>
