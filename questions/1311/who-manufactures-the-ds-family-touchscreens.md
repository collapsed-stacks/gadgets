<p>I'm not sure who the manufacturer is, but <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=8977" rel="nofollow">here's</a> where you can buy one. I haven't been able to find a datasheet, but the part number is <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=AJF&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=lcd-08977+datasheet&amp;btnG=Search&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;gs_rfai=" rel="nofollow">LDC-08977</a></p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<p>If you're brave you could follow the teardown on <a href="http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Nintendo-DSi/714/1" rel="nofollow">iFixit</a>. You might be able to see the manufacturer that way.</p>
