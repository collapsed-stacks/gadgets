<p>To prevent scratches and damages in case of accidental fall, I need a good cover for my HTC HD2. The original cover that came with the box is tight and unpractical. There are lots of cover options in the market but I am hesitant. </p>

<p>The cover should not be very thick as I usually carry the phone in my pocket. It should also not block the speaker. What do you recommend me?</p>
