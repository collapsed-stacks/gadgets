<p>I've tried sending foreign documents (in Icelandic and Russian) to Amazon for conversion and I've tried converting the document to .mobi format and either way, I get gibberish.</p>

<p>What magic trick am I missing to get the kindle to show international text correct?</p>

  <p>It's also possible to convert documents in Russian, Chinese or other non-Latin scripts this way.</p>
