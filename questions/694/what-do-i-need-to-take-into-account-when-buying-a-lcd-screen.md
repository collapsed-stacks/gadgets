<p>I have <a href="http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/products/Monitors/productdetail.aspx?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs&amp;cs=19&amp;sku=320-1070" rel="nofollow">this monitor</a>, and it perfectly good. Now I want to buy another one, and I think to buy the same one.</p>

<p>My question is, what do I need to take into account when buying a new monitor? 
What does this monitor miss, that I'll maybe need in the future?</p>

<p>Maybe look for DisplayPort connections? That one lists HDMI, DVI-D and VGA; but DisplayPort is becoming more common now (especially on laptops, in part because it is much smaller than DVI, and has HDMI resolutions). Here's Dell's view on <a href="http://en.community.dell.com/dell-blogs/direct2dell/b/direct2dell/archive/2008/02/19/46464.aspx" rel="nofollow">DisplayPort vs HDMI</a>.</p>
