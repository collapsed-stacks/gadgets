<p>A location- and network-aware app that changes my profile (for example, silent, loud, and work) based on where I am.  This could be done using:</p>

<ul>
<li>fine-grained GPS</li>
<li>coarse location services (ie. mobile towers)</li>
<li>What wireless networks are visible (for indoors)</li>
</ul>

<p>I'd love to have an app that would change my profile to quiet when I'm at work, back to normal when I'm at home, and silent when I walk into a cinema.  Even airplane mode when I walk into an airport!</p>

<p>Please tell me if there's one available that I don't know about.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_%28text_editor%29" rel="nofollow">Vim</a> keyboard for Android. Without a mouse Vim style editing is so much better than having only a traditional keyboard.</p>

<p>An application like <a href="http://www.transdroid.org/" rel="nofollow">Transdroid</a> to control my Deluge torrent server but from any devices I own : BlackBerry, iPhone and netbook. Same interface, same features, same server. That would rock :D</p>

<p>Not so much an app, more a feature: Wi-Fi synchronisation.</p>
