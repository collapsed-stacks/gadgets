<p>I'd like to buy a digital voice recorder to record classes or language conversation exchanges. IOW, it'll be voice (not music), but the setting could be quiet or a bit noisy. This is not for professional use but I'd like some good quality sound.</p>

<p>I've never bought this type of device so don't know what to get/check.</p>

<p>One feature I need, is the possibility of "bookmarks/indexes", ie. being able to put marks on a recording where it gets interesting so that I can go jump to those sections directly. Also, the recorder must be able to sync with Windows.</p>

<p>Other than that, I have no idea what makes the difference between the different brands and models.</p>

<p>Any feedback/links appreciated.</p>

<p>I used an Olympus WS500M to record lectures in college, and it does have the marking capability you mentioned.<br>
I would recommend that you buy a cheap recorder, but a separate noise-canceling microphone; if you are in a noisy environment, especially if you are not sitting close to the speaker, you may end up recording a lot of distracting background sounds, since most commodity recorders aren't really able to distinguish between voice and noise. It will be cheaper and more convenient to use if you just buy a basic recorder and a higher quality mic. </p>
