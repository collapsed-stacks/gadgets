<p>I am shopping for a cell-phone signal repeater to improve the strength of the signal in my home, and it looks like it is important to get one that is rated for the frequenc(ies) that your particular devices use. Is there any easy way for me to determine the frequency for a particular cell phone?</p>

<p>If it matters the phones also have 3G/CDMA data plans. </p>

<p>It has to work with a Verizon HTC Droid Incredible, a T-Mobile phone, and a Virgin Mobile phone.</p>

<p>I'm not sure about CDMA, but for 3G you can normally get the supported frequencies from the manufacturer's spec. Easiest way to find that is to search on a site like <a href="http://www.gsmarena.com" rel="nofollow">GSM Arena</a></p>
