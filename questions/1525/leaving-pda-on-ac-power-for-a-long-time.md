<p>Is it dangerous or harmful to leave a PDA on recharging unit (connected to AC power) for a long time?</p>

<p>I'm using HTC HD2.</p>

<p>It is best to let the battery go empty at least once a month.</p>

<p>Just like people, batteries live longer if they are exercised regularly. Keeping a battery at full charge all the time actually reduces its capacity.</p>

<p><strong>Response to comments:</strong>  I concede that discarging is not significant when dealing with Li-Ion batteries, which we may assume a modern device as the HTC HD2 uses. <em>Nevertheless, keeping it on external power all the time is not good.</em> For the curious, here is some background which provides arguments to both sides:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Short discharges with subsequent recharges do not provide the periodic calibration needed to synchronize the fuel gauge with the battery's state-of-charge. A deliberate full discharge and recharge every 30 charges corrects this problem. Letting the battery run down to the cut-off point in the equipment will do this. If ignored, the fuel gauge will become increasingly less accurate. [...] The worst condition is keeping a fully charged battery at elevated temperatures, which is the case with running laptop batteries. If used on main power, the battery inside a laptop will only last for 12-18 months. [...] Removing the battery from the laptop when running on fixed power protects the battery from heat.  [...] Avoid frequent full discharges because this puts additional strain on the battery. Several partial discharges with frequent recharges are better for lithium-ion than one deep one. Recharging a partially charged lithium-ion does not cause harm because there is no memory. (In this respect, lithium-ion differs from nickel-based batteries.) Short battery life in a laptop is mainly cause by heat rather than charge / discharge patterns. [...] Consider removing the battery from a laptop when running on fixed power.
