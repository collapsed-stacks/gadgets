<p>I'm in the market for a new laptop, I think I'd like to try one of the hybrid Tablet PC/Laptop's that have a keyboard and swivel round screen, something like the "Tablet PC Dell Latitude XT2" (this model seems to tick all the boxes, but seems quite pricey compared to some of the competition). I want it for a laptop most of the time, but think the tablet functionality would be useful to have for reading stuff. Prices seem to vary hugely and I've been unable to find a site with a reasonable comparison of features.</p>

<p>The things that are important to me:</p>

<ul>
<li>battery life</li>
<li>reasonably small (10-12 inches ideally)</li>
<li>multi-touch</li>
<li>reasonably robust, something thatâ€™s going to last at least a couple of years (I have the impression some laptops fall apart as soon as you look at them)</li>
</ul>

<p>What models would you recommend? Are there any good consumer comparison sites that I've missed?</p>

<p>Many thanks,</p>

<p>Rob</p>

<p>I would recommend a Lenovo X series tablet. They are solidly built ultraportables that let you swivel the screen for use as a tablet. Multitouch drivers are available for windows 7, but I think they are meant to be used with stylus most of the time. They are a little towards the high end of your size range though: I think 12.1" is as small as they go.</p>

<p>I picked up a HP tm2t a few months ago, and I've thoroughly enjoyed it. One thing to note when shopping around for it: check what the screen is capable of; most have either touch or a stylus, but not both (without paying extra in some cases.) As for the tm2t:</p>

<ul>
<li>Battery life, I get anywhere from 8-10hrs depending on usage</li>
<li>It is 12.1" </li>
<li>Multi touch, yes</li>
<li>Its build quality may not be as strong as the suggested Lenovo but its made from cheap plastic either.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm not sure exactly how they compare price-wise, but <a href="http://www.fujitsu.com" rel="nofollow">Fujitsu</a> have a number of models under their LifeBook line.  I have a T4210 that is now almost 4 years old (fall of 2006) and still going strong.  I use it on a daily basis, and love it.</p>
