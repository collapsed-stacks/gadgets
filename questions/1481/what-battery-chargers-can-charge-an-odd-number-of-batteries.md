<p>I have a radio that takes 3 AAA batteries, yet my charger will only charge in pairs. Most battery chargers I have owned will only charge AA or AAA in pairs.</p>

<p>One interesting thing about <a href="http://www.apple.com/battery-charger/" rel="nofollow">Apple's new battery charger</a> is that it can charge either one or two batteries at a time (though it's only AA size I think).  Seems like an obvious capability to have.</p>

<p>Are there other chargers that can charge an odd number of batteries?  Any that do AAA and AA?</p>

<p>La Crosse <a href="http://www.lacrossetechnology.com/900/" rel="nofollow">BC-900</a> does it. It also has a lot of useful capabilities like discharge and fast charge modes. It does AA and AAA, and deals fine with mixed lots. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.thomasdistributing.com/shop/maha-mhc401fsdc-battery-charger-white-model-aa-and-aaa-chargerbrincludes-100240ac-world-adapter-and-12v-dc-power-cordbrfree-deluxe-storage-bag-8-cell-battery-holder-p-655.html?SP_id=&amp;osCsid=a98rm8a91donrsllit8gi3gna7" rel="nofollow">Maha MH-C401FS</a> has 4 discrete charging circuits so it can independently charge any combination of AA and AAA batteries to their individual full capacity.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.thomasdistributing.com/shop/maha-mhc801d-aa-aaa-battery-chargerbrdeluxe-8-cell-professional-battery-charger-w-full-lcd-displaybrbrfree-accessory-bag-2-free-eight-cell-battery-holdersbrspecial-price-6897-p-437.html?SP_id=&amp;osCsid=a98rm8a91donrsllit8gi3gna7" rel="nofollow">Maha MH-C801D</a> is like the one above, but it has 8 independent charging circuits. It also has a fancy digital display which shows you how full (approx) each battery is.</p>

<p>I own both of these chargers and they're both fantastic.</p>

<p>Maha also makes a model that's called <a href="http://www.thomasdistributing.com/shop/maha-mhc9000-advanced-battery-chargerbrfree-deluxe-storage-case-included-p-405.html?SP_id=&amp;osCsid=a98rm8a91donrsllit8gi3gna7" rel="nofollow">the MH-C9000</a> -- I don't own one, but I'm convinced they made it just to compete with the fancy LaCrosse BC-900 charger (which Michael mentioned.) I hear the LaCrosse charger is also a good model.</p>

<p>Maha also manufactures some of the finest AA and AAA NiMH batteries on the market, so their knowledge of battery charging is second to none, IMHO.</p>

<p>ThinkGeek sells a La Crosse BC-9009 <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/gadgets/travelpower/b7fd/" rel="nofollow">http://www.thinkgeek.com/gadgets/travelpower/b7fd/</a> for only $40 that'll do it.  We have one and it works great.  </p>
