<p>Is there a device that i can buy that allows me to take notes and write in text files on an E-ink display, along with something close to a full-size keyboard?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/07/19/how-to-install-pixel-qis-3qi-display-on-your-netbook-and-why/" rel="nofollow">Install a 3Qi e-ink LCD hybrid display in a netbook.</a> With a beefy nine-cell battery, you could get eight hours of battery life plus direct-sunlight readability. That's the only I know to get an e-ink display with a real keyboard.</p>

<p>Of course, if you don't really need the e-ink display, you're probably better off with an iPad and an external keyboard. It has great battery life (for an LCD device), a highly-readable screen (in indirect light), and PDF and text file annotation capabilities.</p>

<p>There are those smart pens that write on special paper (you can print it out thought), and they automatically transcribe it. Have a look at their mentions in writer Charrly Stross's blog, <a href="http://www.antipope.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.antipope.com/</a> he rather likes it. </p>
