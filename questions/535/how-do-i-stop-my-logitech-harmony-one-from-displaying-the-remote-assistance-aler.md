<p>Every time my remote goes to stand-by (screen dims), and I wake it, I get the "Do you want to  hide Remote Assistant" alert. No matter how I answer the alert dialog (yes/no), it comes back each and every time. How to I get ride of this annoying alert?</p>

<p>You can turn this off the in the harmony software on your PC/Mac. From the <strong>Remote Settings</strong> tab of the <strong>Logitech Harmony Remote Control Software</strong>, select <strong>Display Settings</strong>. From that screen there is an option to turn it off.</p>

<p>Once you have done this, re-sync your remote.</p>

<p>When was the last time you updated the firmware?  My older harmony would get stuck in certain loops.  If I went in and made a minor change, write the change to the device, then undo the change and write again it would clear the problem.</p>

<p>Also from the software you should be able to turn off the assistant from there too.</p>
