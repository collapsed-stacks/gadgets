<p>Hey everyone,</p>

<p>I'm looking to take an audio signal from a computer (1/8"), or multiple computers if possible, and send its output to some sort of switch/audio box that would allow me to choose between different receiving devices - say between headphones and a receiver. I dont want to split the signal, and I dont want to send the signal to both at once, I want to be able to choose where the signal goes.</p>

<p>Is there a box that will do this?</p>

<p>Thank you,</p>
