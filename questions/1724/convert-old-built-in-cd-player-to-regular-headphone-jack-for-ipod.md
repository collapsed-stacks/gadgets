<p>My old car has a built in CD (regular redbook non-mp3) player.  I would like to play from my iPod using my car's stereo system.  Its a 2002 oldsmobile intrigue, so I really don't want to spend a lot.</p>

<p>I know I have a couple of options, including a <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Player-Wireless-Radio-Transmitter-Lighter/dp/B0009GZH5S" rel="nofollow">small radio transmitter</a>, which I have, but I'm not pleased with the performance / hassle.  I'd rather just connect my mp3 player to the audio signal for the car directly.</p>

<p>Does anyone know how hard a DIY solution would be where I somehow <strong>add my own</strong> phono jack to the car would be?  Where do I get started?</p>

<p>Just pull off the dash of your car and look at the back of the stereo, there might be an auxiliary input but I'm doubting it. Most stock car stereos that can handle aux input would have a jack on the front. I wasn't able to find directions on removing the dash of your car so you will have to try that for yourself. Most cars have screws or built in clips that need to be loosed by shimmying a screwdriver or something small and flat around the dash that covers the stereo.</p>

<p>Once the part that goes around the stereo is removed you should see screws you can undue that connect the car stereo mount to body of the car. Then you should be able to pull out the stereo and stereo mount.</p>

<p>FYI, depending on how nice your car manufacturer is this may be a big pain or really easy. Look it over first and try a few things before going all out.</p>

<p>If you do not have any other inputs your best bet is going to be an after market stereo. In which case I would recommend something that can directly connect to iPhone/iPod and can control it, like an Alpine stereo.</p>

<p>Good luck to ya!</p>
