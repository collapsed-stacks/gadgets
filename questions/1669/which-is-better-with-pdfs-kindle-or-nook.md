<p>I'm thinking of getting either <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Wireless-Reading-Display-Graphite/dp/B002Y27P3M/ref=dp_cp_ob_kinh_title_1" rel="nofollow">Kindle</a> (not DX) or <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/nook/index.asp" rel="nofollow">Nook</a>. Mostly I'll be reading PDFs, so I need to know which can handle PDFs better?</p>

<p>I'm not buying an iPad because:</p>

<ol>
<li>It's way out of my price range </li>
<li>E-ink will be better for my eyes</li>
</ol>

<p>Additional question:
Is Kindle's battery removable? I know Nook's is.</p>

<p>If the PDFs you read are old (scanned) or multi-column with figures, then re-flow might not work well. You really ought to go with the Kindle DX, as it allows almost full <strong>size</strong> viewing of PDFs. Scaling and zooming are just uncomfortable on both the smaller Kindle and the Nook.</p>

<p>If forced to choose between non-DX and Nook, I would, unfortunately, have to choose to kill trees (due to the papers I read).</p>

<p>And the DX battery is not user removable, AFAIK.</p>

<p>When I <a href="http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/E-book_Reader_Matrix" rel="nofollow">lookup the EReader Matrix from MobileRead wiki</a> it appears that both the Nook and Kindle have PDF support. And the Nook has a slight advantage in that both TOC and hyperlinks function correctly.</p>

<p>@mankoff, What are you using to make that assessment? Viewing the Matrix linked above I see support for PDFs from the Nook, Kindle, and Kindle DX. And the Nook has support for TOC and hyperlinks whereas the Kindle and Kindle DX does not. Also on the forum there is a discussion of PDF support and someone took pictures of his Nook using different PDFs to visibly show support.</p>
