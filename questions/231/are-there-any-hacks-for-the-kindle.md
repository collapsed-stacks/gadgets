<p>Are there any "hacks" which have been discovered for the Kindle? Similar to how the PSP has numerous unofficial firmware replacements which allow for new/improved features, homebrew apps, etc, and iOS devices can be jailbroken for unofficial apps.</p>

<p>Does such a thing exist for the Kindle?</p>

<p>The <a href="http://openinkpot.com" rel="nofollow">OpenInkpot</a> project is working on a Kindle DX port of their open-source e-reader operating system, but it's still at the <a href="http://rampantgames.com/blog/2004/10/black-triangle.html" rel="nofollow">black triangle</a> stage (we're waiting for pictures of the first graphics on-screen.) If <em>everything</em> goes according to plan, the port will be released around late August.</p>
