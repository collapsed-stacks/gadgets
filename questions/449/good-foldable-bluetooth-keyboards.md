<p>I used to have a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Think-Outside-Universal-Bluetooth-Keyboard/dp/B000ORGD64/ref=sr_1_6?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1279558359&amp;sr=1-6" rel="nofollow">Think Outside StowAway</a> Bluetooth keyboard to use with my N800, but the poor thing unfortunately broke over the weekend. I am unfortunately having trouble finding a suitable replacement: Think Outside has discontinued their folding models, and I can't find any other folding Bluetooth keyboards. I'd appreciate any suggestions for a suitable replacement.</p>

<p>Instead of a foldable you might want to look at something like the <a href="http://www.frogpad.com/FPIStore-OnlineStoreBR.html" rel="nofollow">FrogPad Bluetooth iFrog Keyboard</a>. It is a very compact keyboard that uses multiple key presses at the same time to reduce the number of keys required. It supposedly works <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSDMahnw0_g&amp;feature=player_embedded" rel="nofollow">very well</a> and allows up to <a href="http://www.frogpad.com/FPInfo-FAQ.html" rel="nofollow">40 WPM</a> after 10 hours of practice. </p>

<p>Perhaps a <a href="http://www.wirelessgoodness.com/2009/12/24/rollable-keyboard-with-bluetooth-goodness-passes-through-the-fcc/" rel="nofollow">Roll Up Keyboard</a>?</p>

<p>Not sure if/where it's for sale, though</p>
