<p>I really don't like connecting my laptop directly to a public hotspot, there's just too much opportunity for foul play. What I need is a portable private hotspot with NAT routing between me and the public hotspot. I'm talking about something like a basic WiFi router, except that the WAN side would be a WiFi interface, rather than an RJ45 port.</p>

<p>Is there such a thing as a "NATing WiFi-WiFi bridge"? WiFi client on one side (public hotspot), and Access Point on the other (private hotspot).</p>

<p>I am looking for an appliance as opposed to a dongle, etc., so that I can serve more than one laptop.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cisco-Linksys-WTR54GS-Wireless-Travel-Speedbooster/dp/B000A1AQOO" rel="nofollow">WTR54GS</a> can do it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Router function ties it together and lets your PCs share a wired or wireless Internet connection.</p>
  
  <p>You can also create a shared-access bubble attached to a wireless Internet connection to use multiple devices on a single hotspot account in a coffee shop or airport lounge.</p>

<p>If you have an Android device you can use the WiFi Tether app. Works great and the newest version allows you to create a true WPA hotspot so your phone looks like a wireless router.</p>

<p>dd-wrt might do what you need. Check out <a href="http://dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Wireless_Bridge" rel="nofollow">http://dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Wireless_Bridge</a>
I'm not sure if there are any builds for mobile routers though, so you'd need full power to use that on the go.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.asus.com/product.aspx?P_ID=9H8EmdWucHDpYOb8" rel="nofollow">Asus WL-330GE</a> is exactly what you are looking for. Among many other features it can use one WLAN (e.g. carrier hotspot) and use this to build its own WLAN.</p>

<p>With the size of a pack of cigarettes and power supply via USB or standard power supply unit it is portable.</p>
