<p>I've seen some of my friends playing mario and other games on their ti-84s and such. How do I do it?</p>

<p>First install <a href="http://education.ti.com/educationportal/sites/US/productDetail/us_ti_connect.html" rel="nofollow">TI connect</a> after checking that you have the <a href="http://www.ticalc.org/basics/linking/index.html" rel="nofollow">right stuff</a>, then download <a href="http://www.detachedsolutions.com/mirageos/" rel="nofollow">mirageOS</a>. Then follow <a href="http://www.ticalc.org/basics/linking/downloading.html" rel="nofollow">these instructions</a> and take your pick of the <a href="http://www.ticalc.org/pub/83plus/asm/games/mirageos/" rel="nofollow">wide array of games</a>.</p>

<p>An easier way is linking your calculator directly to the other person's if you have the right cable (often comes with TI graphing calculators). Then you can set your calculator to receive and they can choose what files to send you. </p>
