<p>Whenever I use my <a href="http://www.fitbit.com/" rel="nofollow">fitbit</a> to track my sleeping it seems to be overly generous and says that I am sleeping over 90% of the time. And the times that it says I fell asleep seem to be less than accurate.</p>

<p>How accurate is the sleep tracking supposed to be? Are there ways to adjust how it measures your sleep?</p>

<p>Apparently the fitbit is a motion tracker?</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.fitbit.com/faq#sleep" rel="nofollow">official faq says this about sleep tracking</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>How does the sleep tracking work and what will I learn?</strong></p>
  
  <p>It's important that you get a good night's sleep. Recent studies have shown that sleep quality is linked to overall wellness. Have you ever wondered why you still feel tired even though you think you've gotten a full 8 hours of sleep? The Fitbit Tracker will allow to "see" what your body is actually doing at night. </p>
  
  <p>When you get into bed, you slide the Fitbit Tracker onto a wristband that is provided with the Tracker. As you fall in and out of sleep, the Fitbit tracks the movements that your body makes and can tell you how long it took you to fall asleep, how many times you woke up throughout the night and the actual time you were asleep vs the time you were in bed.</p>

<p>An interesting blog post about how "movement tracking" works here:<br>
