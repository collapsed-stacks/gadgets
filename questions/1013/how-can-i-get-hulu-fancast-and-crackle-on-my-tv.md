<p>I've read reviews of various digital media receivers: Roku, WD TV Live, AppleTV, Boxee Box, etc. Each has its strengths and weaknesses. </p>

<p>I'd like to get free movies and tv shows from Hulu, Fancast and Crackle onto my big screen. I've read about how Hulu and Boxee keep playing cat and mouse with Hulu's content. I've not heard whether Fancast or Crackle try to block content the way Hulu does.</p>

<p>What are my options? I'd prefer something that isn't going to be blocked next week. Are there any manufacturer's that have signed deals with these websites?</p>

<p>Just hook up a PC to your TV. Used to be a pain back in the days before HDTV, HDMI and wireless keyboards it's a snap!</p>
