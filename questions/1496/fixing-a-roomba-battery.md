<p>Hi all,</p>

<p>I got a roomba, but with a problem.</p>

<p>The problem is that after I charge the roomba, it can move less then half a feet - and then stops (blipping as if the battery is dead)</p>

<p>If I then charge the roomba, it can again move half a feet, only to die again.</p>

<p>How can I fix the roomba battery in the cheapest/easiest way?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Well.</p>

<p>In the meantime I found <a href="http://www.robotreviews.com/hack2/battery.shtml" rel="nofollow">this article</a>.  And also that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=battery+roomba&amp;tag=googhydr-20&amp;index=aps&amp;hvadid=3359316355&amp;ref=pd_sl_3j80kber8y_b" rel="nofollow">Amazon sells these things</a>.</p>

<p>So I am o.k</p>

<p>Does it play a 4-note song and the power button blinks Red? If it does not, It may not be a battery problem.</p>

<p>How many times does it beep after it dies? Look at the back of the manual and see what your problem is. The number of beeps mean different problems.</p>

<p>EDIT: Here's a web page if you can't find your manual. <a href="http://www.roboticvacuums.net/roomba-talks.html" rel="nofollow">What is Roomba saying to me?</a></p>

<p>It goes "uh oh" and then it starts beeping. Count the beeps after "uh oh" sound.</p>

<p>I had a similar problem. It would back out from the docking station at the scheduled time. It would come straight out about a foot or two and the it would die and beep. Mine died and beeped 9 times which meant a sensor problem. 9 beep problem is quite common for Roomba 500 series and cleaning sensors didn't help for me. I called iRobot support and they said they will replace mine with new Roomba, but mine was out of warranty period which is 1 year... They offered me the newer model of Roomba without any accessories for $129. Still debating whether I should buy it...</p>

<p>I hope yours is not the infamous 9-beep problem. If it is I hope your are still covered with 1 year warranty.</p>

<p>I wouldn't try to replace the battery just yet. It probably just needs to be reset:</p>

<ol>
<li>Run the Roomba until it's dead (shouldn't be too hard for you).</li>
<li>Flip it over and remove the battery.</li>
<li>Hold down the power button for about 5 seconds.</li>
<li>Re-insert the battery.</li>
<li>Plug in the Roomba (safer than docking station) and leave it alone for at least 12 hours.</li>
</ol>

<p>When you start it up again, it should be able to run for much longer. I have to do this with my Roomba occasionally (it may depend on the model, etc). It's annoying, but still a much easier and cheaper fix than replacing the battery.</p>

<p>Edit: These look like the official instructions: <a href="http://robotshop.helpserve.com/index.php?_m=knowledgebase&amp;_a=viewarticle&amp;kbarticleid=1" rel="nofollow">http://robotshop.helpserve.com/index.php?_m=knowledgebase&amp;_a=viewarticle&amp;kbarticleid=1</a></p>
