<p>I understand that RIM (Research In Motion) designed the Blackberry for selling via carriers.  As such there are all sorts of features that require the BES/BIS server at the back end to support, and some that need to be 'enabled' or 'downloaded' to the phone (I think in the form of Service books. </p>

<p>An example is UMA.  This allows making calls over WiFi (which my TMobile Bold 9700 supports), but needs to be enabled. </p>

<p>I understand UMA is a bad example, since you probably need a carrier at the back end to support it, for it to work.  </p>

<p>However, is it possible to get hold of other 'service books' and install them on your BB?</p>

<p>As a corollary, I have sufficient access to our companies BES server, so if needs to be sent via  BES server, I can probably finagle that.  </p>
