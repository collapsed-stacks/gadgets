<p>Ok so this question isn't technically about the phones themselves, but the technologies they use.  It does affect my purchase of a new phone and what technology to choose so I hope it's still valid to ask here?</p>

<p>I live in Canada and I'm currently with Fido, looking to get a new phone (either an android based phone or possibly an iphone) and possibly change providers.  </p>

<p>After looking at a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Canadian_mobile_phone_companies" rel="nofollow">list of providers</a>, I'm seeing a few different technologies being used and I'm a bit unclear as to the difference, and what they mean for me when I'm looking to buy a new phone.  </p>

<p>It seems the main providers use either GSM or CDMA.  I know fido is on the former (on Roger's network)  Now, there are a few new guys on the market (Wind, Mobilicity etc) that offer their services over HSPA.</p>

<p>Now according to the above list, Rogers etc use GSM/HSPA, likewise Bell uses CDMA/HSPA.  Am I correct in assuming that the GSM/CDMA portion of those above carriers is for voice and the HSPA is for data?  Is it then correct to say that Wind (etc) is using <em>just</em> HSPA for voice and data?</p>

<p>I'm asking because I'm looking at buying a new phone on Ebay/craigslist etc and I wasn't sure if I should get GSM,CDMA,HSPA etc etc...  Any insight is greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Below are different Wikipedia articles explaining some of the differences and features of each.</p>

<p>My recommendation would be to find the carrier that has the phone you want. Research the different phones and come up with a list of 3 or 4 that have everything you want. Also do research on the carrier to make sure you have coverage where you want it. Then pull the lever and buy one. This way you get the best of both worlds. If you need it to work internationally then I would hands down recommend GSM. Otherwise this system should work fine.</p>

<p>Wiki articles explaining each technology:</p>

<p>There are no current chipsets that speak both GSM and CDMA. The fact that both voice standards use HSPA for data isn't really that relevant for the moment.</p>

<p>You will need to choose a voice networking technology.</p>

<p>GSM phones are much more easily transferable between providers due to the SIM requirement. CDMA standard technically allows for SIM cards but I haven't seen that in practice.</p>

<p>Qualcomm is making a chipset that speaks both GSM &amp; CDMA but it doesn't exist <em>quite</em> yet as of posting.</p>
