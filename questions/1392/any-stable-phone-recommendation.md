<p>While I like neither their features nor user experience, <strong>Nokia</strong> phones (featurephones more so than smartphones) are known for their stability and bugless experience.</p>

<p>I have had my <strong>Motorola Droid</strong> for just over a year and I am very happy with it.</p>

<p>(Of course, the Droid is now out of stock. However, the Droid X and Droid 2 recently launched, and the Droid Pro is supposed to be coming out later this year.)</p>
