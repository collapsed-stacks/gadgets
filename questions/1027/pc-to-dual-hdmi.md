<p>My PC is connected to both my projector and my TV. </p>

<p>At the moment I am using an Active / Active HDMI splitter which seem to work ok but, once in a while the connection to the TV or the projector will just drop and I need to reboot my computer to get the video back. </p>

<p>Is there any gadget that can stop these kind of drop offs?</p>
