<p>I want to record video non-stop for <em>at least</em> one hour every day. I want to be able to tell the phone to begin recording by pressing a button and the phone should begin to record audio and video for at least one hour without stopping. I want to cache the video in local files and upload them using a 3G+ connection (3.6Mbps), so it needs to be something I can program (and I would like to avoid low-level programming languages).</p>

<p>Which mobile phones are programmable, can record video for as long as possible and support 3G Internet connections?</p>
