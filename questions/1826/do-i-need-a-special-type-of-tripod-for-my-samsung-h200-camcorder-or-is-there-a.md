<p>The above is my camcorder. I saw some tripods specifically geared toward this, but I'm wondering if I can just get any random tripod and use it.</p>

<p>Any tripod should work with it. I've never had or seen a modern consumer-grade camera and tripod that did not work together. Older heavier camcorders did have problems on lightweight tripods, however, but that's not an issue with a camera such as yours. If you have the opportunity, try out the tripod before you buy it. Some are more stable than others. Some inexpensive ones are unusably wobbly. For use with a camcorder, you will want to see if the pan and tilt head operates smoothly and is easy to operate (lock and unlock, etc.). You'll also want to make sure that it can be set to a comfortable height and has a useful range of heights.</p>
