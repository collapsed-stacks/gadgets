<p>How do you reset the "Furthest page read" on a Kindle?</p>

<p>Recently I was reading a book on my Kindle and my Android phone.  After clicking on an end-note link, the Kindle remembered that as my "furthest page read" and I had to give up using the syncing for the rest of the book.</p>

<p>Apparently the only way that still works is to <a href="http://www.kindleboards.com/index.php/topic,29458.msg541528.html#msg541528" rel="nofollow">turn off sync and blow away the book file</a> 
:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Go to Amazon.com and to your "Manage
  Your Kindle" page.  On the bottom
  under your list of purchased books,
  you'll see "Manage Synchronization
  between devices".  Go there and you
  can turn it off.</p>
  
  <p>Here is what that page says about
  turning synchronization off:</p>
  
  <p>"You should turn synchronization off
  only if:   You and someone else are
  reading the same book, AND   The
  Kindles are registered to a single
  account"</p>
  
  <p>Then, if you open your root directory
  while your Kindle is attached to your
  computer via USB, you can find the
  .mbp file for the book in question and
  delete it.  This file stores the
  memory of how far you were in that
  book.  When you view the book again,
  it will be as though you just opened
  it for the first time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This blows away any notes, highlights, etc. as well though, so it's a pretty poor solution.</p>

<p>This annoys me to no end when rereading books, and don't feel like deleting book files, so hopefully they fix this in a later version. </p>
