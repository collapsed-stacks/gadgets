<p>I'm looking for a portable device (e-book reader, iPad-style device or similar) to enable me to read academic papers on the move.</p>

<p>The essential features are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Large screen - preferably around A4 size so that the paper appears at true size</li>
<li>Ability to read <strong>and annotate</strong> PDFs</li>
<li>Good battery life</li>
</ul>

<p>Features which would be ideal are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ability of the device to do other useful things (eg. if I can get a device which can also run other apps, access the internet etc)</li>
<li>The device not being too locked down (ie. Android would be better than iPad)</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, the other factor is price! I'm a student, so cheaper is better, but I'm willing to pay a bit more to get a quality product. I'd be particularly interested to hear from anyone who is using any device like this to read academic papers.</p>

<p>You need an iPad. The only one of your specifications it doesn't meet is your preference for openness, but it still meets more of your requirements than any other released device. The <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/06/02/kno-dual-screen-tablet-appears-at-d8-we-go-hands-on/" rel="nofollow">Kno</a> e-reader may eventually be a better fit, thanks to its massive screens and academic focus, but it will never match the iPad's massive selection of useful apps. If I were you, I would start looking for iPad deals.</p>

<p>While I love the iPad, I am also looking into other alternatives. The <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/nook/index.asp?cds2Pid=30195" rel="nofollow">Nook</a> seems to be pretty cool. <a href="http://nooktalk.net/news/time-to-hack-root-your-nook" rel="nofollow">You can hack it</a> and get some pretty cool features as well. Since it's not very expensive (and FREE 3G), it's looking like a pretty viable alternative to me.</p>

<p>Well, the iPad <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2010/04/02/seven-more-ipad-alternatives/" rel="nofollow">isn't</a> <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/07/14/the-ipad-alternatives-the-where-are-they-now-edition/" rel="nofollow">the</a> only device out there.  Still, you find many things by searching for <a href="http://www.google.com/#q=ipad+alternatives" rel="nofollow">iPad alternatives</a>, but hey.  Maybe the iPad <strong>is</strong> what just what the doctor ordered.</p>
