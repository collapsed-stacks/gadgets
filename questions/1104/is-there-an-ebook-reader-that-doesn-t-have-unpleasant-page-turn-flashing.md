<p>I've looked at some of the fairly recent models (as well as one or two of the early models) of Kindle, Sony and Nook. Each one has a jarring, unpleasant flashing/scrambling on the screen during page turns.</p>

<p>Is there a model available now or just around the corner that doesn't exhibit this behavior? Other priorities are availability of a wide range of titles and compatibility with a variety of file formats.</p>

<p>When changing data to display, e-Ink screen must be cleaned up and then data is displayed. Also e-Ink screens are a lot slower than LDCs or other ordinary screens. That makes flashing. </p>

<p>Sooo... Look for not e-Ink based readers. For example iPad or any smartphone :-)</p>
