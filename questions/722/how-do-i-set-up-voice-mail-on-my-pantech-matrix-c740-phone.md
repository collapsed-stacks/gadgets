<p>I have a Pantech Matrix C740 cellphone with AT&amp;T and I'm having a difficult time setting up the voice mail.</p>

<p>When I call the voice mail center to set it up, it asks me to input my mailbox number, and I have no idea what that is. What I've read is that it's my 7-digit personal number for that specific phone, so I input that, and it says "Sorry, did not find a mailbox for this number" and then "Please enter the mailbox number specified by your system manager" or something to that effect.</p>

<p>I don't know if this is relevant but: the phone is registered in Michigan (989 area code) and I just moved to Massachusetts (617 area code). I can still call and text message fine, but I don't know if moving out of state would affect my voice mail - the number for the voice mail stored on the phone hasn't changed since I got it.</p>

<p>I may have already called the voice mail center before but failed to set up the voice mail properly. I can't remember one bit if that happened or not, but if it did, how could I go about and reset my voice mail message?</p>

<p>Am I doing something wrong?</p>

<p>This looks like it's more of a problem with your provider (AT&amp;T) than with the phone itself. I've moved my SIM around between phones without issue once Voice Mail is set up.</p>

<p>The seven digit number seems to be the issue - I bet it's <em>assuming an area code</em> which is not correct for your situation and location.</p>

<p>Okay, so I've contacted AT&amp;T and the process for resolving this issue is as follows.</p>

<ol>
<li>Call <code>611</code>, follow the voice prompts to get to customer service. (Alternatively you could just call the line directly at <code>1-800-331-0500</code>. This may be preferred because you need to turn off your cell phone for part of the process.)</li>
<li>Have your account holder's name and last 4 digits of their SSN on hand. They need this information to access your phone and records.</li>
<li>Talk to the representative and explain that your voice mail isn't working, and they will offer to reset your voice mail system.</li>
<li>As part of resetting your voice mail, the cell phone in question needs to be turned off. If you are calling from that phone, they will ask for an alternative number and they will call you on that. You can then turn off your cell phone.</li>
<li>They will reset your voice mail system. You may turn the phone back on when prompted.</li>
<li>From there, just hold <code>1</code> or call the voice mail on your phone, and follow the voice prompts to set up your mailbox number. You need to devise a 4-digit passcode for your mailbox.</li>
<li>Enjoy your new voice mail system.</li>
</ol>
