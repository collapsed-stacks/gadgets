<p>We are evaluating a new Windows Mobile device at work and I'm looking for something that will allow me to stress the processor, ideally the display as well, see how hot the device gets after extended use, battery life, etc.  Whatever I can get.</p>

<p>Does such a thing exist?</p>

<p>Microsoft has a piece of software called Hopper that is used to test windows mobile phones. Here is a <a href="http://mobileappstesting.com/2010/06/07/how-to-use-hopper-a-stress-testing-tool-for-windows-mobile/" rel="nofollow">few</a> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsmobile/archive/2007/06/13/how-to-run-hopper-on-your-application-step-by-step-procedures.aspx" rel="nofollow">blog posts</a> and a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/bb964490.aspx" rel="nofollow">video</a> that talk about how to use it. </p>

<p>If the device supports flash, try viewing Flash videos and playing Flash games non-stop for several hours. That ought to stress your device.</p>
