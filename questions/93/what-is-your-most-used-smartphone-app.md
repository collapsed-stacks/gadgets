<p>Most used, not most useful, or best ... that would be subjective and much less interesting ;)</p>

<p>One per answer, vote for those that you use.</p>

<p>If you are adding an answer, please indicate what features the application has that make you use it, also include a link to the application's site and a screenshot if relevant.</p>

<p>HippoRemote is a great app that will allow you to remotely control a computer(Linux, OS X, and Windows support) via a VNC connection.  The more expensive versions of the app come with profiles for using a variety of common applications such as Chrome, Firefox, iTunes, VLC, XBMC and many more.  I use this as a remote for my XBMC media center and it is invaluable.</p>

<p>Locale for Android, $10, very handy, changes ring/alert volume based on things like location, time of day, plugged in, who it is (another $1 to add SMS related alerting, many, many plugins to extend it), etc. So, at work, things are a bit muted, an home, sleeping time, plugged in, very muted, unless the alert system pages me for work, or the other on call people call me, then extra loud. I love not missing calls because I forgot to turn the ringer up, or being woken (I worked a swing shift) because I forgot to turn it down.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.babyesp.com/" rel="nofollow">Baby ESP</a> (Eat, Sleep, Poop) -- as of writing, my son is 1 month, 1 day old (it says so, right at the bottom of ESP). My wife and I use this app to track feedings, diaper changes, medicine, sleep patterns, etc. We each had to pay the $3.99 but the sync feature make it well worth it. The feature-list is great, development is on-going, and support is fast.</p>
