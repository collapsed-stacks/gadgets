<p>My wife's Nokia Communicator 9300 (a Symbian series 80 device, if memory holds) still works, but is beginning to show many signs of wear and tear .. besides locking up ever more frequently. So we decided to migrate her to an iPhone.</p>

<p>Does anyone know of a simple way to extract address info (must) and agenda (nice to have) from that phone in such a way, that it can be imported to the iPhone. </p>

<p>Is there a way to sync it to anything else? I did the transfer from my old Palm by syncing it to a computer (outlook? I can't remember), then syncing that to Google Calendar. Once I had the data in Google Calendar, I just synced the iPhone to Google Calendar and everything was in place and ready to go - calendar, contacts, the whole works. </p>
