<p>My experience is on the HTC TP2, but it's a similar enough device to the HD2, I think.</p>

<ul>
<li>Any app which uses the GPS heavily (Google maps, etc.)</li>
<li>Any app which sends/receives a lot of data (mail client, web browser)</li>
<li>Any app which keeps your screen bright for a long time</li>
<li>Any app which uses a lot of CPU cycles</li>
</ul>

<p>I personally would not un-install anything unless you're really not using it, but things like Google Maps you should close when you're done. With your mail client, you should consider setting it to check for updates once an hour or once every two hours. And then only downloading the first 5K of the email.</p>

<p>There are settings which enable the phone to lower the screen brightness. Maybe you don't need it at full-bright all the time. Maybe you want it to auto-dim sooner or go completely dark sooner. The screen wastes a ton of power.</p>

<p>Recently, I had a situation where the Sense UI was taking forever to index my text messages (I had over 4000 on my phone.) It was gobbling up CPU cycles and slowing down my phone (not to mention draining the battery.) Deleting the majority of the text messages made it go faster again (and consume less battery.)</p>

<p>My last tip is to keep a charger near you all the time.</p>

<ul>
<li>At work, I have a USB cable coming out the side of my monitor. When I get to work, I plug my TP2 in.</li>
<li>In my car, I have a 12v USB car lighter adapter with 2 USB ports. I attach my phone as soon as I get in the car to help keep it charged wherever I go.</li>
<li>At home, I have a charger upstairs and downstairs so that I can keep my phone charged up, yet within range of my Bluetooth headset. (so I can still answer calls)</li>
</ul>

<p>Good luck. Hope this helps.</p>
