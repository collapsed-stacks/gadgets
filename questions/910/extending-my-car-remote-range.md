<p>At this time, I literally have to hold my fob on my car to get the remote to work. And I know it's not the battery.</p>

<p>I've seen a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=extend+range+on+car+remote&amp;hl=en&amp;prmd=v&amp;source=univ&amp;tbs=vid:1&amp;tbo=u&amp;ei=5O1STNXpEMWjnQeats3NAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=video_result_group&amp;ct=title&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CD0QqwQwAw" rel="nofollow">few videos</a> about extending signal range and I wanted to know if any of them really work:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hold the fob to your chin - this should work, but not in my case.</li>
<li>Add aluminum foil behind the battery (another video disproves it).</li>
<li>Solder a wire on the antenna inside the remote.</li>
<li>Extend the receiver antenna.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Have you tried contacting your VW dealer? That doesn't sound like a range problem, it sounds flat-out <em>defective</em>.</p>

<p>I'd at least confirm with your dealer before trying any range extending trickery... having to hold it up against the car is just crazy talk.</p>

<p>The trick about holding the fob under your jaw really does increase range. I've tried it myself and I get about 50% more range out of it. I use it rarely, but it's a neat little trick that comes in handy when you need it.</p>

<p>Pressing it against the side of Your head also extends range. And it looks funny :)</p>
