<p>I want to buy an external numberpad for someone who uses a laptop as their primary computer and has to do a fair amount of numerical data entry (e.g. entering grades). I've read conflicting reports about whether the numberpad should have a numlock key and arrows (setting numlock could interfere with normal typing on a laptop keyboard). </p>

<p>What are some important characteristics of a numberpad that I should consider? What are some good external numberpads?</p>

<p>This doesn't directly answer your question, but have you considered using a full external keyboard? You can get a great keyboard for <a href="http://www.techzulu.com/ask-techzulu-whats-the-best-keyboard.html" rel="nofollow">less than $50</a> which would have a quality num pad. If you're using the laptop in only one or two locations, buying a couple of keyboards and leaving one in each location might be simpler and easier.</p>

<p>If you definitely need an external numpad, a friend of mine has and likes the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Wireless-Number-Pad-N305/dp/B0034XRDU0" rel="nofollow">Logitech Wireless NumberPad N305</a>, it's built like a brick and you can assign some handy shortcuts to the hot keys.</p>
