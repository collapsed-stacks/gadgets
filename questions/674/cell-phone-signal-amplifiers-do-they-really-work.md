<p>I get almost no signal inside my house on any cell phone carrier, so I was thinking about buying one of those cell phone amplifiers (for example <a href="http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/searchtools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1829799&amp;pagenumber=3&amp;RSort=1&amp;csid=ITD&amp;recordsPerPage=5&amp;body=#ReviewStart" rel="nofollow">this one</a>), but since they are kind of expensive, I was hoping to get some unbiased information on them from the community.</p>

<p>Are these worth the money? Do they work with smart-phones/data plans? Any advice on picking a good one?</p>

<p>I have tried the specific zBoost device you mentioned in two different places with two different zBoosts.  Both failed to increase the signal in any reliable way.  I spent lots of time on the phone with their support staff and played around with various cable lengths and positioning all with no results.  It is possible these things work (their Customer Support department seemed really convinced they normally do) but I certainly cannot recommend them based on my experience.  Also..these boosters traditionally help transfer signal from one area to another (ex: you have great signal in your yard, but none in the basement...) so if your entire neighborhood area has no signal, this type of booster has no chance.</p>

<p>If your carrier provides one, I suggest picking up a microcell and using that. Instead of merely boosting an already weak signal, a microcell connects to your home broadband connection and acts as a mini cell tower in your home:</p>

<p>i have installed <a href="http://3gstore.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=73_41&amp;products_id=556&amp;zenid=mhcmri52mjbskd61548c48sv14" rel="nofollow">this device</a> in my vacation home with good success. this trick is you have to find a spot where your cell phone DOES work and put a directional antenna there. in my case, i put it on the top of a 30 foot aerial so that i would clear the hill behind the house that blocked the signal.</p>
