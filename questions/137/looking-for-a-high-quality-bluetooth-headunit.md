<p>I currently have a head-unit that handles Bluetooth cell calls, but the audio quality is absolutely horrible. I have the Sony MEX-BT5000 unit.</p>

<p>Help? What head units are out there that are high quality from the point of view of call quality?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: A head-unit is the technical name for a car stereo receiver.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.jawbone.com/" rel="nofollow">Jawbone</a> makes excellent headsets. I had one of the previous ones (lost it), and loved it. I could hear very well, people could hear me, and it fit really comfortably. I think when I bought mine it was about $120, which is more than you'd pay for lots of others, but it was worth it IMO. <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/01/18/aliph-jawbone-icon-the-ace-bluetooth-headset-review/" rel="nofollow">Here's</a> a review. </p>
