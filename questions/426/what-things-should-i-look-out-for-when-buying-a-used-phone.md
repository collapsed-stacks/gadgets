<p>Some phones are locked to a specific carrier, and may not be usable with your network. Many of these can be unlocked, sometimes voiding the warranty.</p>

<p>Batteries can become worn down over time. If the device has been used for a year or more, the battery life can be considerably shorter compared to a new one.</p>

<p>Some phones have stickers inside the phone that indicate whether the device has been damaged or exposed to water, voiding the warranty. These are typically not visible from photos of the outside of the device.</p>

<p>Physical Damage and Wear.</p>

<p>Phones can get really disgusting (they're right up against a user's face), so make sure it has been cleaned, or clean it after you get it.</p>

<p>Smoking damages electronics as well. If a phone smells like smoke, it's probably going to have a shorter lifespan.</p>
