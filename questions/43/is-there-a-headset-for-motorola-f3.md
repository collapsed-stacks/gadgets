<p>The official specs of the Motorola F3 mobile phone clearly say that the single jack on the side of the phone is for both chargers and headsets.</p>

<p>The problem is that I've never seen any proof that a compatible headset was produced. The <a href="http://www.motorola.com/Consumers/US-EN/Consumer-Product-and-Services/Mobile-Phones/MOTOFONE-F3-US-EN" rel="nofollow">official Motorola website</a> offers two "compatible" headsets - both bluetooth. That doesn't make sense, since the F3 doesn't support bluetooth at all.</p>

<p>So. Is there a F3 compatible headset? If no, did anyone succeeded in putting together one DIY-style?</p>

<p>There seems to be a <a href="http://www.mobilephonecrazy.com/modeldetail/Fone-F3,Personal_handsfree_kit.htm" rel="nofollow">hands free kit</a> with a single headphone and mic. I've not seen any stereo headsets for this phone.</p>
