<p>Land lines have had name and number caller ID for <em>decades</em>. I understand it costs the service provider money to provide this service and that may be why they don't provide it. However, I <em>want</em> it.</p>

<p>How can I get number AND NAME caller ID on my cellphone?</p>

<p>I'm willing to consider any combination of phone, provider, app and even pay for the privilege, if necessary.</p>

<p>I'm in the U.S.</p>

<p>Cellular networks do not support caller id, but there are 3rd party services that will use your data connection to send the phone number to a server and retrieve caller information. I believe they only work on networks that allow data and voice at the same time, and they usually require a monthly fee. On Windows mobile you can check out <a href="http://www.privusmobile.com/phone-caller-id.html" rel="nofollow">Privus</a>. <a href="http://www.truecaller.com/" rel="nofollow">TrueCaller</a> appears to support iPhone, Symbian, Windows Mobile, Blackberry and Android. Try searching for "{PHONE OS} Caller ID" and see what apps you can find. </p>

<p>Here is a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKqhfYZY4cY" rel="nofollow">video showing how it works</a>. Notice that it has to send data to a server (using 3G connection) before it can display the information. </p>

<p>The current cell phone signalling mechanisms in use don't have a standard way of passing the caller ID name information from the SS7 connections back in the phone network. As a result, in the US anyway, I am not aware of any providers delivering this information to the user of a handset. ie: Only the calling phone number is passed.</p>

<p>However, in many cell phones, if the inbound number is found in your contact list, then the name will be displayed according to what you have in your contact list.</p>

<p>As a follow-up comment. If you are use a smartphone with SIP VoIP based calling application (as a data call along the lines of something like Skype), then SIP VoIP provider and the client application would have the (theoretical) ability to support both Caller ID Name and Number. However, I don't know of a specific example to offer as a suggestion....anybody else!?</p>

<p>For the Android, have you checked out the <a href="http://www.appbrain.com/app/com.skydeck.razor" rel="nofollow">Mr Number</a> app?</p>

<p>I have downloaded it on my Android phone and it works for the most part.</p>
