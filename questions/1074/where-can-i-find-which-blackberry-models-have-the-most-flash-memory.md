<p>I know how to find the Free Memory and Total Memory of a single Blackberry device, but I'm interested in buying a new Blackberry device with the most built-in flash memory available.  Is there a good website that shows blackberry device specs and lets you compare them? </p>

<p>Blackberry's own website: <a href="http://na.blackberry.com/devices/compare" rel="nofollow">http://na.blackberry.com/devices/compare</a></p>
