<p>My parents use <a href="https://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/GenericSearchResult.cfm?RequestTimeout=500" rel="nofollow">one of these</a> to carry TV from the cable box to a room that doesn't have a cable jack. However, whenever it is on, the wifi signal in my room (which is between the room with the transmitter and the room with the receiver) dies.</p>

<p>I'm going through the documentation now, but I have no idea how to determine what channel I should change my wireless router to in order to avoid interference from this device. The only thing that I found that might be of use was a four-way switch labeled "Channel" and the four positions labeled "D", "C", "B", and "A" from left to right. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to figure out which channels these correspond to between 1 and 11 (the supported channel range of my wireless router).</p>

<p>If worst comes to worst, I want to buy my parents a new device like this that does not interfere with wifi signals. Any recommendations if that becomes necessary?</p>

<p>Although wireless TV senders use the same 2.4 GHz frequency as WiFi, they don't follow the same approach to channel management. Basically the video signal is broadcast across a large part of the frequency so acts as a pretty effective WiFi blocker. The positions on the sender will allow you to select a part of the spectrum so you <em>may</em> be able to find a combination that works for you by trial and error. I don't think there is any standardisation of these channels though. My own experience with 2.4 GHz units was that they interfered with Wifi no matter what I tried.</p>

<p>If you need to send TV signals wirelessly, then look for a set that uses 5.8 GHz instead of 2.4 GHz. Personally I now avoid video senders like the plague so can't recommend any particular unit, but if you Google "5.8 ghz video sender" you should find several options.</p>
