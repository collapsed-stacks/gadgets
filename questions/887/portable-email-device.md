<p>I have this gadget in my head, but I don't know if it exists anywhere. Here's what I'm thinking:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Email. That's what I want this device for. I want to check my email. I don't need a web browser, I don't need a phone. I don't need an ebook reader. I just want to read my email.</p></li>
<li><p>Phone-sized. I don't really need a huge netbook type device. I want to carry this in my pocket. If it's a bit bigger like the Dell Streak that would be fine. I'm just not looking for something remotely laptop or iPad sized.</p></li>
<li><p>Built-in keyboard. Since this is mostly an email device, I want a real keyboard.</p></li>
<li><p>Wifi connection. I don't want the recurring costs of a smartphone's data plan. I'm around wifi often enough to not really need an always-on connection.</p></li>
<li><p>Preferably somewhat cheap (less than $100 would be great.less than $200 would be acceptable) </p></li>
</ul>

<p>I've seen a few devices like the N800 series and the Sony Mylo, but they're either old or expensive or both. I saw the Peek device, but that's $300 if I don't want to pay them a monthly fee. The ZipIt Z2 looked wonderful, but they're charging a monthly fee for a wifi device, and there's no way I'll do that. The only real option I see at this point is to wait a few months for Apple to release the latest iteration of the iPod touch.</p>

<p>Does anyone know if a gadget like the one I describe exists?</p>

<p>I use an old smartphone for this. It has no SIM card inside, just using WiFi.</p>

<p>I guess you can get old smartphones or PDAs for a reasonable price, second-hand.</p>

<p>You state you want a physical keyboard, but that you want to wait for Apple to release a new  iPod touch? Which is it?  Personally I would go for a used smartphone, that has a keyboard, and a decent web-browser, so that means probably an android device like the HTC DREAM which has a real keyboard and a decent webkit based browser.</p>

<p>The Peek that you mentioned appears to be the only single purpose email device that has wifi and can be purchased without a monthly service fee.</p>

<p>Its not as inexpensive as you would like (in fact it cost a little <strong>more</strong> than the Peek without a service plan) but the <a href="http://www.open-pandora.org/index.php" rel="nofollow">Pandora</a> has wifi, a querty keyboard, a small form factor (smaller than a netbook but a little larger than a Nintendo DS) and no monthly service fee. Its designed primarily as a gaming/entertainment device but can be used for general purpose computing as well. It has an app <a href="http://apps.open-pandora.org/" rel="nofollow">store</a> although calling it a store is a bit of an exageration. All the apps I looked at were free. I didn't find an email client but there were both a desktop and mobile version of Firefox available so I'm sure Thunderbird isn't far behind. Being a hobbyist device based on Linux you could always port an email client if you have the skill (or know someone who does).</p>

<p>According to the website it costs 349 USD (without VAT) or approx. 330 EUR (including VAT).</p>

<p>The project has suffered from a number of delays in production but is now taking orders for a shipment that should go out in October. I certainly want one.</p>

<p>Another option is the Landel <a href="http://www.mailbug.com/mb1.html" rel="nofollow">MailBug</a>. It's a single purpose email device like you want. The initial out of pocket is close to what you want but it does have a small monthly service fee and no wifi so you'd be tied to a phone line.</p>

<p><strong>Bottom line</strong></p>

<p>Most single purpose email devices have not sold well so there isn't any incentive for manufacturers to continue making them.</p>

<p>You could try an older model Toshiba Libretto but none of the older models came with wifi built-in and only a few came with a pcmcia expansion slot.</p>

<p>Sounds like you want a Blackberry device (that incorporates WiFi). It can run SIM-less/service-less and shines with email and keyboard input. (I've used a plethora of smartphones and while I'm currently on a Droid, I miss the Blackberry's keyboard.) They appear to be quite cheap on eBay too, just be careful you don't purchase a dud or a device without WiFi.</p>

<p>You won't be able to utilize the built-in mail application, but loading a third-party one is a cinch. (<a href="http://www.logicprobe.org/proj/logicmail" rel="nofollow">LogicMail</a> is a great alternative.)</p>

<p>I recommend Nokia's line of Communicator smartphones because they have decent hardware keyboards, not touch-screen or Blackberry-style clicklets. If you need to <strong>write mails</strong> and not just read mails then you're going to appreciate having a decent keyboard!</p>

<p>There are several Communicator smartphones to choose from, and there's certainly a market for used devices. They all have WLAN. Some have greyscale LCD insetad of color screens, these have the benefit of a much longer battery life.</p>
