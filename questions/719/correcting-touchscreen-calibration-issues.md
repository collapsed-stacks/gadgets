<p>I have a GPS with a touch-screen that has become less accurate over time, especially when pressed gently. Now, it can be quite frustrating to enter an address.</p>

<p>The first part of my question is generic: What causes touch-screens to degrade over time? I thought it might be batteries, and tried to ensure it was charged, with no effect. I thought it might be dust or oil on the screen, and tried cleaning it with alcohol - again, no effect.</p>

<p>The second part is more specific to the device, a NAVMAN S30. If screens just naturally lose their calibration, is there a way to recalibrate it? I've been unable to find one online or in the manual.</p>
