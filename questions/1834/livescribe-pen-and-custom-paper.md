<p>I plan to buy a LiveScribe pen ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livescribe" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livescribe</a> ).</p>

<p>My only fear is about the special <strong>'dot' paper</strong> which is rather expensive (25$).</p>

<p>Does anyone know if it is possible to print a custom version of this paper?</p>

<p>According to the manufacturer you can <a href="http://www.livescribe.com/int/support/kb/?View=entry&amp;EntryID=104" rel="nofollow">print your own paper</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dot paper notepads can be printed directly using Livescribe Desktop and a Color LaserJet Printer that Adobe PostScript compatible and can print at 600dpi or higher.</p>

<p>We have clients that use this kind of technology for their workforce. You're going to run into the following issues DIYing your paper:</p>

<ul>
<li>The DPI required to print the dots is outside the realm of most printers available to regular consumers</li>
<li>Scaling will be a big issue to get sorted out. Even if you manage to score an A4 template and print it on A4 paper, most printers will scale it so that it fits within the printable area of your printer. This will screw up the measurement</li>
<li><strong>This is the big one</strong>: The microdot patterns that uniquely identify the location of the text on the page are covered by international patents and copyrights. This means if you attempt to roll your own you could be sued into oblivion by the owner of the patent.</li>
</ul>
