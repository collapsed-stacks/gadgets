<p>Is it a bad idea to charge my phone with an 8V charger rather than the original 5V one?</p>

<p>I lost the original charger a few days ago but managed to find another transformer with the same plug on it but a higher output voltage. I don't want to buy a new one if I don't have to, so I've tried plugging it in for a short while, and it charges happily, but I don't want to do any lasting damage to the phone by using it repeatedly!</p>

<p>Usually devices can handle a range of voltages but I would keep that within +/- 10%. 5V to 8V seems a bit much.  </p>

<p>You can get by for a short while if you make sure not to overcharge, but you should get a matching adapter as soon as possible.</p>

<p>USB puts out 5 volts, so depending on your phone, you may be able to grab a cheap USB cable and charge it from your PC.</p>
