<p>Hello, I would like to buy a new phone. Currently I'm on AT&amp;T with a Samsung Impression(which I hate with a passion because of stability and customization problems). What phone would you suggest buying? I don't want to buy a smart phone and I also don't want a touch-screen only phone. A full keyboard would be great but is not absolutely necessary(if it has a physical number pad), as is a touch screen interface. I'm willing to spend up to $200 on a phone. Also, I may be looking at switching my service to Verizon or T-Mobile so I'm not only limited to AT&amp;T.</p>

<p>Also the main thing I do on my phone is some light talking, very heavy texting, and light web browsing(like check facebook sometimes with m.facebook.com, etc). </p>

<p>I've heard good things about the <a href="http://mytouch.t-mobile.com/" rel="nofollow">MyTouch 3G Slide</a>'s keyboard. As Android phones go, its physical keyboard is better than the Droid or the Ally, and much better than any touchscreen keyboard can ever be. Though it does run Android, HTC has a custom interface for the device that makes it a lot more like a feature phone than a smartphone. Of course, your best bet is to go to a T-Mobile store (or a reseller) and try one out.</p>

<p>Well, check out T-Mobile Sidekicks, they used to be quite awesome in that regard. But I don't think they have the cheap plans they used to.</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure Blackberries still have the best keyboards. I'm not sure about the text-messaging experience, but it would be pretty hard to mess up a simple messaging application.</p>

<p>You can save money on messaging and data plans with the smaller carriers, Sprint (200 minutes and messaging from $35) and T-Mobile (500 minutes and messaging from $45), as well as looking at prepaid plans. Just make sure that most of the places where you spend your time have good coverage.</p>

<p>There are a few phones with wide slide out or flip open qwerty keyboards, which can be more natural message devices for heavy computer users. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>My enV2 (Verizon) has run like a champ and it's nearly to contract completion. </p>

<ul>
<li>Verizon (non-smart) phones all have the same limited User Interface for simplified customer support</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Samsung produces a sliding keyboard phone called Rant, or other names depending on your carrier</p></li>
</ul>

<p>As with every phone, try it at a store, or play with a friend's first if you can. Ask what they like and dislike about the interface and try to use the phone features your regularly use.</p>

<p>I actually ended up getting an HTC Tilt 2. Yea, it's a smart phone, but it meets all my specifications and plus I can install Android on it if I so please. It's also a nice phone, though I like the Touch Pro 2 variant more than the Tilt 2</p>
