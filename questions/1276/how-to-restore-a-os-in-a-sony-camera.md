<p>I have some issues with my Sony Webbie camcorder. The technician suspects that the OS of the camera needs to be re-installed. I've heard that we can restore the OS which resides somewhere in the Camera itself. How can I do it?</p>

<p>By OS, do you mean the Camcorder's firmware? If so, it appears as if you can download the latest Webbie HD firmware (for model MHS-CM1) from here: <a href="http://esupport.sony.com/US/perl/swu-list.pl?mdl=MHSCM1&amp;SelectOS=7" rel="nofollow">http://esupport.sony.com/US/perl/swu-list.pl?mdl=MHSCM1&amp;SelectOS=7</a></p>

<p>If that isn't your model number, search for the correct model number in the box on the right side of the website.</p>
