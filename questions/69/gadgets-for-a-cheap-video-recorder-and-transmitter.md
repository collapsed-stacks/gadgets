<p>I want to capture and send video from a toy car to my computer. (Kind of like a remote-controlled Security Camera on wheels.) I know I can use my cell phone, but it's actually a very expensive device and then I can't use it for anything else.  I have a wireless Internet connection in my house so I could connect to it, or broadcast to some receiver elsewhere in the house.</p>

<p><strong>What are my options for cheap gadgets that capture video and transmit (live) wirelessly?</strong></p>

<p>This really depends on both your definition of cheap, and how dirty you want to get.</p>

<p>You could probably hack a wireless router to send video. As matter of fact, <a href="http://www.jbprojects.net/projects/wifirobot/" rel="nofollow" title="WifiRobot">here is a link</a> to a guy who did some serious hacking to come up with a really neat project.</p>

<p>Another more expensive but easier option would be just buying a wireless security cam setup and using that.</p>
