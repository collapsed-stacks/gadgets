<p>Is there really any advantage of having a a radar detector in your car?  Is it "too late" by the time a radar detector detects a cop clocking you?  Is there any point in having one in your car?</p>

<p>I'm looking for a list of some pro/cons here, so I made this a CW.</p>

<p><strong>Generally, detectors are not worth their while.</strong> They cost money and don't save you from getting caught if you do go over the limit, and they might bring you an additional fine. </p>

<p>Keep in mind that in many countries it's <strong>illegal</strong> to even <em>have</em> a detector in the car (even if it's turned OFF! even if it's not yours, etc. etc.). Similarly, some countries prohibit the use or even <em>possession</em> of navigation units that contain locations of speed traps.</p>

<p>Needless to say, you're better off staying under or reasonably near the actual speed limits...</p>

<p>A little background:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Laser</strong> measurement is instantaneous and precise. So laser detectors are useless because <em>if</em> they work at all, it's certainly too late when they alert you because you've already been measured.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Radar</strong> is more of a wide-angle approach, so a radar detector might alert you in time, but there's no guarantee and there's a good chance it is being triggered by something else instead. So effectively, a radar detector is also not very useful.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>My laser detector rarely goes off. It's my understanding that if you do get a laser alert, it's almost always too late. I generally ignore X-band signals since they are almost always false. When I get a Ka band alert, I pay attention.</p>

<p>Since regular radar travels a pretty good distance and bounces around, you'll often get alerted before you're the target.</p>

<p>The behavior of the traffic around you can tell you a lot. A radar detector can provide additional information on top of your own awareness.</p>

<p>One feature I really like is auto-mute which reduces the volume of the audio alert after a few beeps at the set volume.</p>

<p>I've found that I've usually seen an ambulance or fire truck by the time the emergency vehicle alert goes off. I've only gotten false alarms for train alerts.</p>

<p>I use an older Cobra that has laser, voice alert, compass, etc.</p>

<p>Some jurisdictions prohibit or limit the use of radar detectors.</p>

<p>All that having been said, the usual disclaimers apply. Drive within the speed limit, etc.</p>
