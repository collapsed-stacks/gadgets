<p>What is the best way to get a good overview of what apps are currently already availiable and will be availabe after the launch of Windows Phone 7? Maybe there is a website that keeps track of all announcements that have been made so far?</p>

<p><a href="http://marketplace.windowsphone.com/Default.aspx" rel="nofollow">This is probably your best bet</a>. May not be exactly what you are looking for, but is the official app site for WinMo.</p>

<p>FYI, Getting apps into MS' marketplace will probably be slow going at first because of how MS setup their system to charge developers. But the one advantage you have with purchasing a WinMo phone is that once you unlock it you can run Android on it as well and then play around with both.</p>
