<p>Hi Michael,</p>

<p>I've been using a fantastic bluetooth speaker from Samsung for over a year now. The full name is YA-SBR510. Unfortunately it's pretty hard to buy at the moment, but it has been present on British ebay some time back so maybe that's just a temporary supply shortage...</p>

<p>Sound quality is truly amazing and you can hook up any device that has bluetooth enabled. I have paired it with multiple laptops, an ipod touch, Nokia N900 and Nokia E51 without any problems.</p>
