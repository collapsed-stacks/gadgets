<p>I want this phone, but I also want to be able to hook the phone up to my tv and I don't have a DLNA tv.  So since it doesn't have an HDMI-out port are there alternate ways to hook it up to display on a TV?  I believe the other new Samsung phones have the same issue.</p>

<p>The Samsung Epic 4G is a flavor of the Samsung Galaxy S.</p>

<p>The Galaxy S had the option of using the 3.5 jack for video-out already, and recently Samsung introduced a micro-usb to HDMI cable.</p>
