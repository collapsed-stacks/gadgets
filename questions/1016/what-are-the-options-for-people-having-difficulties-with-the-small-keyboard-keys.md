<p>Many BlackBerry users at my office asks me for a way to help them because they found it difficult to use the small keys on a BlackBerry phone like 9700 or 8300.</p>

<p>Is there something that could help them? I'm thinking about maybe a stylus to help them click the keys, or maybe an adapter they could plug on their finger to better click the keys or a really small Blutooth keyboard?</p>

<p>Any constructive comment is welcome.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>If you want to get really fancy, and don't want to carry around a full sized keyboard you could try a <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/interests/techies/8193/" rel="nofollow">bluetooth laser projection keyboard</a>:</p>

<p>Here is a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBIi-suIR-Q" rel="nofollow">video</a> of it in action.</p>

<p>It isn't cheap, but it does wonders for your geek-cred. </p>
