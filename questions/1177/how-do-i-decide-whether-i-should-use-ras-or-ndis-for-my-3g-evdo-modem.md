<p>Just got a Novatel MC760 3G/EVDO (Verizon) modem and this thing came with absolutely no documentation. I'm trying to sort out the best configuration settings for my enviornment.</p>

<p>One setting I don't fully understand is the connection mode. The options are "Modem (RAS)" and "Network (NDIS)". They both seem to work, but I have no clue as to why I should chose one over the other.</p>

<p>If it matters I am running this on a Windows XP computer, but plan to eventually use it on a 3G router for a wireless network with Windows 7 and XP computers, an XBOX 360, and a few iPod Touch devices.</p>
