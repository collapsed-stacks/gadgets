<p>From <a href="http://www.pocketpicks.co.uk/index.php/2009/04/20/hackers-paying-top-dollar-for-nokia-1100-phones/" rel="nofollow">Hackers paying top dollar for Nokia 1100 phones</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It seems that the humble Nokia 1100 
  is the new weapon of choice in the
  arsenal of the electronic fraudster. A
  bug in the phone’s firmware means that
  it is possible to intercept other
  people’s SMS messages and this has
  given organised criminals a way of
  hacking internet bank accounts.</p>
  
  <p>The exploit relies on the fact that
  many European banks use one-time
  passwords for any electronic
  transaction. These passwords are sent
  to customers using SMS messages. By
  obtaining user data and using hacked
  Nokia 1100s to intercept SMS messages,
  hackers can divert funds into other
  accounts using valid one-time
  passwords that both banks and
  customers assume are secure.</p>
  
  <p>Authorities in the Netherlands became
  suspicious when they noticed that
  Nokia 1100 handsets were changing
  hands online for huge amounts of
  money. Security researchers say the
  are not 100% sure how the exploit
  works and are trying to duplicate it.
  In the meantime, the asking price for
  a Nokia 1100 has jumped from £5,000 to
  £22,000 in just a few months.</p>
