<p>Physical media is dead ;p</p>

<p>I'm tempted to start hosting my movies on a NAS RAID box, but I'm unsure of my options; in particular, I'd like media to be available to both my Windows machines and the PS3 (since that is connected to the TV).</p>

<p>Obviously I can just download movies to the PS3 via the store, but I'm pretty sure I'd struggle to make that data available to my Windows machines.</p>

<p>Are there any options here (in terms of both the physical NAS/RAID, and the way I use it) that are:</p>

<ul>
<li>easy to set up (relatively; we're gadget geeks here, after all...)</li>
<li>allows convenient <em>legal</em> downloads that can be shared by both (and doesn't involve me having to buy and rip my own disks, or visit the darker corners of the web)</li>
</ul>

<p>Anything else to watch for?</p>

<p>Have you looked at Pogoplug and the Seagate Docsktar?</p>

<p>With the Dockstar you just plug in an external hard drive, and can access it from anywhere on your local network - or if you set up a Pogoplug account you can access it externally too. The nice thing about that is you can leave it on all the time and it doesn't take too much energy or heat up the room.</p>

<p>I don't have a PS3, so I don't know about the file compatibility. Where do you usually get your downloads from? It looks like videos/music from iTunes will play on the PS3, but I'm not seeing much Amazon support. </p>
