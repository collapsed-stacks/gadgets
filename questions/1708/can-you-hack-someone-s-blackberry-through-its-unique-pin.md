<p>I have seen many people posting their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackBerry#BlackBerry_PIN" rel="nofollow">BlackBerry PIN</a> (an eight character hexadecimal identification number assigned to each BlackBerry device) on social networking sites. </p>

<p>Definitely BlackBerry people should have forseen this. So are BB PINs hack proof? Has anyone heard of instances of hacking a BB using the PIN? Just curious to know.</p>

<p>According to Wikipedia the PIN <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackBerry#BlackBerry_PIN" rel="nofollow">can be used for messaging</a>, so making it public should indeed not harm anyone:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>BlackBerrys can message each other using the PIN directly or by using the BlackBerry Messenger application.</p>

<p>As Arjan says, the PIN used to be the main way to add a contact into Blackberry Messenger  this is why social sites have an option to list it (it's still an option, but I think most people use the email address to identify their contacts now, as that works even when you change devices).</p>

<p>The PIN isn't like a security PIN number like the one's used as a password for things like ATMs or to unlock phones, it's just a unique code that identifies that Blackberry on the Blackberry network (think of it as more like a mobile phone's IMEI number, or a network device's MAC code).</p>

<p>The only way that this could make a Blackberry easier to hack is that it's a way to uniquely identify and target that Blackberry (on the Blackberry network), it doesn't give access to anything. These days I can't believe that it's of any more value to a hacker than knowing their target's Blackberry email address and phone number, which I'd assume the same people are also putting up on the social sites.</p>
