## Digital Camera with Video Comparable to Flip HD

<p>I'm looking to buy a video camera on a budget. Looking at some of the digital video camera reviews, the Flip Ultra HD usually ranks in the highest, but the videos I have seen are rather jerky due to the lack of image stabilization. Since most still shot digital cameras have video as well, I'm wondering how their video compares to the Flip.</p>

<p>Does anyone know of any still shot digital cameras that have comparable video to the Flip?</p>

<p>More specifically, if there are still shot cameras that have the same video quality as the flip, I would consider just buying a still shot since I'd get the same video capabilities.</p>

<p>The canon sd1400is looks comparable both price wise and quality wise.  </p>

<p>However the advantage the flip or vado have is that they are dead simple to use also I think audio is likely to be a bit better. </p>

<p>Since you didn't state your budget, I'm going to tell you what worked for me (not real cheap, but has completely replaced our more expensive HD miniDV camcorder and our more available-but-not-as-high-quality iPhone3GS):</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/products?q=panasonic+lumix+zs3&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3aen-US%3aofficial&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;ei=lQ2QTNv0H4a4sAPylvGxDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=product_result_group&amp;ct=title&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDsQrQQwAA" rel="nofollow">Panasonic Lumix ZS3</a></p>

<p>You could buy the newer ZS7, but this one has all the features I love: 720p HD (AVCHD Lite) recording with stabilization, a decent P&amp;S camera, amazing 12x zoom (works in video mode too) and a zeiss lens. The movie mode is quite good even in low-light.</p>

<p>The best part is the touch-to-record button... if it's on, click the red record button and you're taking movies.  Much faster than my old-style camcorder, unbelievably faster than the iPhone, but probably not as fast as a Flip Video.</p>

<p>Camera is also small and fits in my wife's purse (the best camera is the one you have).</p>

<p>Also wanted to add this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/panasonic-flip-video-mino-quality/forum/Fx2EVYIOTVLQPS9/Tx3KFM22SX8KMO9/1?_encoding=UTF8&amp;asin=B001QFZMCO" rel="nofollow">comparison thread</a> between the ZS3 and Flip HD Ultra.</p>
