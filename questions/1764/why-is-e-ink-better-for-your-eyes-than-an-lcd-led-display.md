<p>I've been wondering for quite a while and have been hearing that E-Ink is generally better for your eyes than a LCD/LED display.</p>

<p>Why is it so though?</p>

<p>I'm not sure I've necessarily heard that it is better for your eyes. I've heard people say that they can read on e-ink better than an LCD so maybe it puts less strain on eyes. But studies showing extended use of LCD screen having damaging effects just aren't there.</p>

<p>I think e-ink is becoming popular for reading because it really looks just a like a book and isn't affected by light the same way. So reading on a screen with e-ink is certainly a more pleasurable experience indoors or outdoors. </p>

<p>If this technology interests you I also recommend checking out Pixel Qi screens. It is basically the best of both worlds (LCD and E-ink).</p>

<p>The biggest advantage is that E-Ink doesn't flicker like a screen does.</p>

<p>All screens have to refresh themselves, so what you see on your computer or TV even if nothing is moving, if alot of flashing lights (most of the time are set to 60Hz which is about the same speed as your eye), all that flashing can cause your eyes to get tired.</p>

<p>E-Ink however doesn't refresh, unless it needs to. (Which is why you can turn the power off on an E-Reader and it will still display whatever was last on the screen.</p>

<p>Try making a video of a regular monitor or TV and you'll see what I mean, it'll look like the screen is flashing where as if you do the same with an E-Ink screen there won't be anything like that.</p>

<p>LCD/LED Backlights lead to eye strain.</p>
