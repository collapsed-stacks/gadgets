<p>Does the Desire come with a file manager (not application manager), or do you have to download a file manager like ASTRO File manager?</p>

<p>HTC Desire does not contain a file manager. None of the Android devices I've seen contains a file manager by default. But there are several very good ones on the Market like ASTRO, ES File Explorer and AndroZip if you need to work with archives.</p>

<p>You'll probably have to download a file manager app, I got mine from Orange in the UK and it didn't include one.</p>
