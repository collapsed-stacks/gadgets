<p>I am taking my family on a long road trip this winter and I am looking into possible ways to get video into our car. One idea I had was combining a ZuneHD with the HD AV Dock which will provide HDMI out. Then I can run the video cable to some aftermarket video screen and run the sound into the car stereo.</p>

<p>I am not much of a car customization guy but I do know some about audio/video type stuff. Is this a crazy idea or could it work?</p>
