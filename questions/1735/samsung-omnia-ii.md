<p>If you're referring to Samsung Widgets Apps, there is the standard "More Widgets" apps that will connect to Samsung Widget Apps store.</p>

<p>If you're referring to Windows Mobile Apps, you can use MS Windows Marketplace for Mobile. The "Marketplace" can be accessed from the Start menu on the top left of the Omnia II screen.</p>
