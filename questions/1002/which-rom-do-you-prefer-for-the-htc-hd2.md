<p>Which ROM do you prefer for your Windows Mobile HTC HD2. I prefer the Artimis ROM from XDA, but many people still use the Stock ROM.</p>

<p>Is this because of fear of "bricking" your phone, or warranty fears?</p>

<p>I use Dutty's Creme de la Creme ROMs (from HTCPedia.com).  They are very close to stock ROMs, but they seem to work better for me (subjective).</p>

<p>The majority of the cooked-in software is stuff I use, and he leaves things like the documents tab out, although they're available as CAB files if you want them.</p>

<p>I don't have the HTC HD2, but I have a TouchPro2 and use the "Energy" ROMs. It looks like he cooks 5 variants for the HD2: <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=591784" rel="nofollow">http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=591784</a></p>
