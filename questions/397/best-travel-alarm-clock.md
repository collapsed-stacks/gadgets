<p>I've been on the hunt for a long time for a good portable alarm clock to use for travel.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.brookstone.com/travel-alarm-clocks-with-temperature.html?his=2%7E46337%7E2%7Eroot_category%40kwd%7Ealarm+travel&amp;bkiid=searchResults|C4CategoryProdList1FDT|7098369" rel="nofollow">This</a> is the one I've had for about 9 years (which I originally bought from RadioShack) - it does the job, and I especially like the size and how it displays the room temperature, however the alarm itself is quite jarring and it is slightly cumbersome to actually set the alarm time.</p>

<p>There has to be a better designed travel alarm clock out there - bonus points if it has an alarm that fades in (rather than a sudden jarring sound) and if it displays the room temperature.</p>

<p>EDIT: <strong>I'm looking for a standalone device as I want to use this when I may not have my (smart)phone with me...</strong></p>

<p>I have this travel clock (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Timex-3531T-Indiglo%C2%AE-Travel-Alarm/dp/B0009IEB0S" rel="nofollow">Timex Indiglo</a>) which works very well for me. It doesn't have the ascending alarm like you wanted, so maybe look at a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Elgin-3502E-ELGIN-TRAVEL-ALARM/dp/B00007E8E6/ref=pd_sim_gs_e_1" rel="nofollow">similar clock</a> here.</p>

<p>I use a mobile phone as a travel alarm clock. In particular a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_5220" rel="nofollow">Nokia 5220</a>, but I think any mobile phone has this functionality. </p>
