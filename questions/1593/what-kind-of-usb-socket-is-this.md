<p>I have come across this USB socket and even with Google's help, I'm having a hard time deciding what kind of connector it is. It is found on the dock of TimbaTec Nautiz X5 (Windows Mobile 6.1) device dock. I need a USB cable for it and am not sure which to buy.</p>

<p>Right now I am leaning toward USB Micro Type B cable, but maybe someone here has more experience than I do.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Micro B is exactly what it looks like.  It's hard to tell from the image because there's not much context to compare it against.  Is it actually about 1/4" (7mm) wide, more or less?</p>

<p>Take your device along to the store and compare it to the connectors.  (Make sure you tell them at the front that you're carrying something in...)  Most of the connector styles are different enough that you can decide between them pretty easily.</p>

<p>From the accessories order page at timbatec, it appears to be a 20pin USB cable. </p>

<p>Seems like it's wider than a MicroB port. How many pins can you see in there?</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s definitely not a regular, Mini, or Micro USB port, or any other connector I've seen. Mini B has a much fatter center tab, and Micro B's tab is offset.</p>
