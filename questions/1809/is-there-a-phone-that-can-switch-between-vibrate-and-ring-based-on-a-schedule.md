<p>I have times of the week when I know my phone should be on vibrate and other times when I would prefer it to be on ringer.  Basically I want a phone that will switch between vibrate and ringer at specific times every week.  Even better would be if I could also add non-repeating changes for before and after one time events.  To keep dreaming it would also be able to turn off even vibrate for any but a specific set of numbers during specific time periods.</p>

<p>Edit:  Phones that can do this without an app would be preferable, but it it takes an app to get this basic phone functionality I'll take those answers too.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://tasker.dinglisch.net/" rel="nofollow">Tasker app for Android</a> has all sorts of events that can be set up for clock/calendar events, gestures, locations and other triggers. Including turning on/off the vibrate mode. Does NOT require root access!</p>

<p>See "AutoSilent" for iOS. Requires jailbreak. Silences based on schedule and keywords in iCal events (e.g. meeting).</p>

<p>I use Advanced Volume Mode Scheduler on my android phone.  I don't think it's a free app, but the utility that it offers is well worth it.  It can turn radios on and off, set the brightness, scene lockout period, and of course, the volume of the ringer and media.</p>

<p>You haven't specified which phone OS you prefer.
WindowsMobile also have apps that will automatically change phone profile (that includes vibrate/ringer status) based on time of day (and other criteria).</p>

<p>I just heard about <a href="http://www.androidcentral.com/blocco-has-moxy-needs-good-polish-and-better-english-support" rel="nofollow">Blocco</a> -- looks like Tasker, is free, and is excellent if you speak Chinese ("it is at the moment, written more for people located in Asia").</p>
