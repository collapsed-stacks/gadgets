<p>I recently bought a Mitsubishi DLP HTDV (WD-60c9).  I love it so far, with one small exception.</p>

<p>When I'm viewing a HD channel with my cable box (Scientific Atlanta, Time Warner, with the new  "blue" firmware), the screen will go black for 5-10 seconds whenever I go into any menu (channel guide, DVR, etc.).  This problem does not occur when viewing an SD channel.</p>

<p>I think the issue may be that the cable box is switching resolutions and always displaying the menus in 480i or 480p resolution, whereas the HD channels are at 720p or 1080i, and the resolution switch is what's taking so long, although it could be an issue with HDMI input in general.</p>

<p>This is annoying, and the problem also occurs (very infrequently) during some commercials on HDTV channels as well, usually when fast forwarding in the DVR.</p>

<p>Any ideas of settings in the cable box or the TV that I could adjust to alleviate or correct the issue?</p>
