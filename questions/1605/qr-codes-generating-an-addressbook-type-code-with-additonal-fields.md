<p>I'm looking for software and/or a website that will generate a QR code (2D bar code) of the type ADDRESSBOOK. The catch is, I'd also like the code to contain a Twitter handle and, possibly, other social media information.</p>

<p>I found many sites that will generate a basic ADDRESSBOOK code but I want to add / customize the fields in the code. It needs to be an ADDRESSBOOK type or the user won't be given the option to add to contacts on their mobile phone.</p>
