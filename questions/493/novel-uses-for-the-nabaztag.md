<p>I've had a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabaztag" rel="nofollow">Nabaztag</a> for a while and have it set up in the living room. </p>

<p>I'm interested in making more of it, so: what are some interesting configurations or integrations with other gadgets, along the lines of <a href="http://www.androlib.com/android.application.nl-jsource-wabbit-android-nEn.aspx" rel="nofollow">Wabbit</a>?</p>

<p>Interesting, I wasn't aware of these gadgets!</p>

<ul>
<li>Wake up and sleep at predetrmined times</li>
<li>Read your email for you</li>
<li>Read the news for you</li>
<li>Can be "married" to another nabaztag... it will reflect the motions and colors of the nabaztag of a special someone far away</li>
<li>Can send sms or make phone calls for you</li>
<li>It can be moody and say random things at random times</li>
<li>It can recap the week for you and give you its point of view about your week together</li>
<li>It can do tai-chi</li>
<li>It can tell you the time</li>
</ul>

<p>Apparently there is a new version the Nabaztag/tag? It has some new capabilities:</p>

<ul>
<li>Leave messages for a friend or yourself</li>
<li>Voice Activation</li>
<li>Audio Out so you can connect your Wi-fi rabbit with external components such as speakers</li>
<li>WPA Encryption on top of WEP encryption</li>
<li>Ambient Noise Detection</li>
</ul>

<p>I found a few ideas here:</p>

<p>A firm I once worked with had one hooked up to <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.4/svn.ref.svn.c.blame.html" rel="nofollow">svn blame</a>, vocally shaming the person who broke the latest code base.</p>

<p>I think that it would be able to sit still for very long periods of time, and meditate.  Perhaps it would be the first gadget to attain englightenment, and become the Buddhanabaztagsattva.</p>
