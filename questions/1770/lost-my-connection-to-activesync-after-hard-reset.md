<p>I have an HTC Ozone with Verizon Wireless, it recently failed to boot so I did a hard reset.  Problem is now when I connect the phone to my computer ActiveSync will not recognize it, so I cannot get my contacts back.</p>

<p>Is there a file or something stored on the computer that I can access to get my contacts back, or some way to make ActiveSync recognize my phone?</p>

<p>Once you hard reset a phone it takes the phone back to square one. It is essentially wiping the phone. In the case of a phone that has been rooted, or with WinMo unlocked then it means the phone is reset back to the way it was right after you put a custom ROM on the phone.</p>

<p>So you will not be able to recover any files from the phone after a hard reset. Unless those files are stored somewhere else other then where the system files are stored. If you had an activesync connection previously then it should be safe to assume the computer you were syncing with has some of the files from your phone right? That is assuming you told activesync to move those files, because you do not have to move anything after making an active sync connection.</p>

<p>After a hard reset I think you just need to create a new profile for active sync. It should prompt you to do this if necessary after plugging in the phone. But if nothing pops up after plugging in the phone I would fully power off both devices and unplug the phone. Then turn both the computer and phone back on. Wait for both to fully come back up and then plug in the phone. See if you get activesync to come up after that.</p>
