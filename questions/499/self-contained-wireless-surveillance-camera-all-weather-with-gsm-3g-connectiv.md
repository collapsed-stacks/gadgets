<p>Looking for a wireless security/surveillance camera:</p>

<p>Needs to have:</p>

<ul>
<li>All Weather (can withstand subfreezing to very hot outdoor temperatures)</li>
<li>Totally wireless/self contained; IP-enabled</li>
<li>Battery Powered; preferably integrated, but can be an external battery pack as long as it's swappable (can swap a fresh battery in immediately to keep the camera running with minimal downtime)</li>
</ul>

<p>Nice to have:</p>

<ul>
<li>WiFi or preferably unlocked 3G/GSM connectivity for IP connection</li>
<li>Night vision-type mode for low light</li>
<li>Zoom/Pan/Tilt</li>
<li>Charges via Solar</li>
<li>Integrated (but accessible) battery</li>
<li>Discreet so it can be locked up or hidden as to not draw attention itself (anti-theft)</li>
</ul>

<p>So far I've come across the <a href="http://www.brickhousesecurity.com/cellular-surveillance.html" rel="nofollow">Global Watchman System</a>, however it appears to be locked to AT&amp;T for use in the US [edit: and is now discontinued and not available for sale] <strike>since this will be installed in Canada I need to find out if it can be 'unlocked' to work on a local SIM-compatible GSM carrier or determine what data roaming packages are availble</strike></p>
