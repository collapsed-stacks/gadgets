<p>Looking for some recommendations on a GPS tracker.</p>

<p>I don't need it to navigate, I just need it to log coordinates every x seconds while hiking</p>

<ul>
<li>USB connection to computer or card
transfer</li>
<li>reasonable battery life (12+ hours)</li>
<li>rechargeable via USB from computer or
has exchangeable batteries (AA/AAA)</li>
<li>No Windows specific software - I am using Mac</li>
<li>just want data (x, y, time) as CSV or
standard format like GPX</li>
<li>automagical geotagging of Nikon RAW
files and JPEGs on inserted card (SD
and CF) would be awesome</li>
<li>works in Europe and Americas</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>I use an <a href="http://global.mobileaction.com/product/product_i-gotU_USB.jsp" rel="nofollow">i-gotU GT-120</a>, mostly for contributing to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStreetMap" rel="nofollow">OpenStreetMap</a>. I think it meets all of the requirements - see notes below about non-Windows software.</p>

<p>The battery life is several days even when sampling at the highest rate, 1 sample/second. It can connect via Bluetooth to cameras and geotag the images. I haven't tested this feature.</p>

<p>The accompanying software is for Windows, but in <a href="http://the-gadgeteer.com/2009/03/19/i-gotu-usb-gps-travel-logger-gt-120-review/" rel="nofollow">this review</a> it is stated:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"As I use Linux I was initially worried about lack of support but happily someone has created a command line utility which works under Mac OS X / Linux which allows you to pull the data off it in a GPX format which can then be used by Google maps, etc."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Other notes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>it is <strong><em>not</em></strong> suited for <a href="http://www.esri.com/news/arcuser/0103/differential1of2.html" rel="nofollow">differential GPS</a> (not to be confused with DGPS) if the stationary unit is an i-gotU GT-120; unfortunately it locks to a fixed position when at rest (after a few seconds).</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="http://global.mobileaction.com/support/sub-igotU/F1-2-10.htm" rel="nofollow">firmware can not be upgraded</a>. </p></li>
</ul>
