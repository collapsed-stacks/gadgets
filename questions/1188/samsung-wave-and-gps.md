<p>My Dad just got a samsung Wave and the GPS takes forever to load, Outside with all the advanced GPS features turned on. My Iphone 3G, I just open Maps app and tap on find location (the little arrow (ios4)/target(ios3))and it fins my location within a minute.
On the samsung wave I've waited about 20 minutes, and all the GPS infomation is 0, including the number of connected satellites. </p>

<p>What can be done to fix this?   </p>

<p>Make sure that your device is connected to internet, so it can use

<p>GPS can take some time to get a fix, especially if it's not AGPS. AGPS 'cheats' by using the location of the cell phone tower as an assist (hence "A" in AGPS)</p>

<p>I've had my FreeRunner take 15 minutes, and I've had it take 15 seconds. I've also had it go for 45+ minutes without getting a fix...all in the same location (my home office). It's AGPS, but the FreeRunner has some known issues w/ noise on nearby buses (the sdcard for one)</p>

<p>It may just be your phone, it may be the phone, or it may be that your GPS signal is weak and the iPhone is cheating w/ AGPS. Test it with a commercial GPS device (a Garmin, TomTom, Magellan, or something).</p>
