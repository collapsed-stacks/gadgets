<p>Hi I am looking for a second mobile phone for a holiday into South East Asia (Laos, Cambodia, Vietname etc).</p>

<p>Am going to put a local sim into my iPhone to save on data costs on that but would like a second phone to put my home sim in. I don't need any features beyond making calls though it would preferably it would have an excellent standby battery life and clear calls and the cherry would be it uses USB for charging (so i can charge it from my laptop.)</p>

<p>Any suggestions...</p>

<p>Depending on how long you will stay there and especially if you need to make local calls over there, it might be a good/better solution to buy a cheap mobile phone with a prepaid card on location.</p>

<p>A lot of places will rent phones for travelers.  I've never done it before, but a quick Google search turned up <a href="http://www.cellularabroad.com/" rel="nofollow">Cellular Abroad</a> at least as an example of what I'm talking about.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>Here's a much better site to lay out your options for pay as you go sim cards in other countries - <a href="http://paygsimwithdata.wikia.com/wiki/Pay_as_you_go_sim_with_data_Wiki" rel="nofollow">paygsimwithdata.wikia.com</a></p>

<p>Have you ever thought about a mobile phone with dual sim? (<a href="http://www.dual-sim.eu/" rel="nofollow">Some dual sim phones</a>) Perhaps this is the best way to meet you requirements.</p>
