<p>I have a cable/internet subscription with Time Warner Cable, and are using their supplied HDTV/DVR cable box. I am thinking about buying a TiVo to replace it, which I understand will require the use of a CableCARD to decode/record the HDTV signal without TWC's cable box.</p>

<p>I have heard that the CableCARD technology could be replaced in the near future. Does it still make sense for me to pursue the TiVo, or should I wait until whatever replaces CableCARD to hit the market and the next generation of DVRs?</p>
