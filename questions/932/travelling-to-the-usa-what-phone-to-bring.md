<p>I am travelling to the USA this October (2010) (from the UK) and currently have an iPhone. I'm going to want a decent data plan while travelling, and I realise that AT&amp;T is the only option over there for the iPhone.</p>

<p>So, what phone (platform) is best for me to take over, and what network provides transient travellers with the best pay as you go smartphone deal?</p>

<p>Would it be best to buy a used android device (which one), or is it worth the hastle of getting a non AT&amp;T iPhone working with their Go Phone PAYG plans?</p>

<p>AFAIK, only AT&amp;T are able to supply US customers with iPhones, but if you have an unlocked iPhone from elsewhere, it should work on any plan on any GSM network. You just need a sim card.</p>
