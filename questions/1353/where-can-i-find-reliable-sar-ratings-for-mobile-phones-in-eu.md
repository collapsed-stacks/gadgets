<p>I'm in the market for a new mobile phone. Where can I find reliable information about their radiation levels?</p>

<p>I live in Israel, which as I understand uses EU ratings, so I'm interested in those.  I know that the FCC makes their ratings public at <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/sar/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/sar/</a>, but I understand that the the models marketed in the US and in the EU are not necessarily the same.</p>
