<p>I read on my 1st Gen Kindle, and my iPhone kindle app.  Whenever I change pages on the iPhone, and later read on the Kindle, the Kindle recognizes that it's on the wrong page, synchronizes, and changes pages.</p>

<p>But the Kindle never <em>sends</em> the page updates back to Amazon, so I'm stuck having to remember where I was in the story, and manually scroll in the iPhone.</p>

<p>Any suggestions?</p>
