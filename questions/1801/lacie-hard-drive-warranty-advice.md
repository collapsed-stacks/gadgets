<p>Hey,</p>

<p>I have a couple of these <a href="http://www.lacie.com/uk/products/product.htm?pid=11016" rel="nofollow">lacie hard drives</a>:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/bX2Ko.jpg" alt="alt text"></p>

<p>And as one is coming up to the end of it's 2 year warranty, I wondered. Is it best to only turn it on as and when I use it or is it best to leave it on the whole time (I'm sure it has a sleep mode on it as you can hear the drive booting up when you request to use it after a long time of not). I'm just slightly concerned as I don't really know how long it will last for and obviously don't want to risk losing my data!</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Your best strategy will be to <strong>ALWAYS HAVE A BACKUP</strong>.</p>

<p>With proper backups in place, I suggest using those drives however you'd like to. Without a proper backup in place, stop what you're doing, and get a proper backup solution in place, <strong>asap</strong>.</p>
