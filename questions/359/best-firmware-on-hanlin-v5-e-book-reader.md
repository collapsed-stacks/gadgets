<p>The <a href="http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/Hanlin_V5" rel="nofollow">Hanlin v5</a> e-book reader, also known as Papyre 5.1, LBook V5, BeBook mini, EZ Reader Pocket Pro and maybe many other names has a variety of firmwares available, but not as many as its larger and older cousin the Hanlin v3.</p>

<p>I have found the LBook firmware the most advanced one and it's frequently updated.</p>

<p>What firmware are you curently using?</p>
