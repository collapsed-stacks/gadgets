<p>I get a lot of HTML email that's too complex for my BB Curve to handle well, and I use a lot of GMail filters on my GMail account, so I'd like to only be able to <strong>send</strong> emails on my Curve, and not <strong>receive</strong> them at all.  I'm also hoping this will help my Crackberry addiction a bit.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Have your tried creating a filter? Try creating one and put "*" without quotes into the from address and then set the option "Do not forward messages to the device". That should block all email for the primary email used on the device. Then test by sending an email from the device to an account you can check and then try to send one to the email used on your device.</p>

<p>Here's how I did it, it really was obvious once I found it.</p>

<p>On the BB, go to Messages->Menu->Options->Inbox Settings->Uncheck the email account.</p>

<p>Edit: That didn't actually do what I wanted - IE: hide the notification of new messages.</p>

<p>I realise this doesn't really answer your question, but is possibly an answer to your original problem (and too long for a comment).</p>

<p>I'm not totally sure here from what you've said, but are you talking about mail coming into your Blackberry's email Messages app, or about mail coming into the separate GMail app? Or even just visiting the mobile version of the GMail website?</p>

<p>If the Blackberry's Messages app, then have you checked to see if there's a newer version of the OS for your BB, check here for what's been <a href="http://na.blackberry.com/eng/support/downloads/download_sites.jsp" rel="nofollow">authorised by your network for your device</a>, and compare to the version on your BB at the moment (Options -> About, or hold down <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>H</kbd> on the home screen). If I remember right, almost all of the Curve devices except the new Curve 3G came with BB OS 4, OS 5 is much, much better at handling HTML mail, and got better with newer versions of OS5 too.</p>

<p>From your comment to @Webs though, it sounds like you're using the GMail app, first check you're running the latest version of that by pointing your BB browser at m.google.com/mail  when you start the download it'll tell you whether it's a newer version than you've already got or not (it's worked with Apps accounts for a long time now). You should be able to create a filter on the Gmail website for your account (using a PC) to put all incoming mail in the Archive, which should hide it from your mobile device. Settings -> Filters, To: *, Skip the Inbox (Archive It).</p>

<p>The Blackberry web browser pre-OS 6 is not great, compared to other modern smart phones, so it's never going to be perfect showing formatted HTML mail, but any rules you create on the main website with a PC will also work on the mobile version of the site.</p>
