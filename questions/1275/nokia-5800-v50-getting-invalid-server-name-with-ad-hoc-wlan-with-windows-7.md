<p>hello,</p>

<p>After upgrading to v50 firmware in my nokia 5800 xpress music phone.</p>

<p>I am not able to connect to ad-hoc wlan network in my laptop(windows 7 os).</p>

<p>I have a dialup internet connection and created wireless ad-hoc network to access the internet in my phone. But i am getting "invalid server name" in the phone and my wireless network access type in windows 7 shows "no internet access".</p>

<p>I am able to connect to wlan infrastructure network using 5800 in my office. So my phone is working with wlan and i m able to access internet on it. <strong>BUT The problem is "dial up with ICS enabled" and "AD-HOC wlan network" in Windows 7.</strong></p>

<p>Can anyone give some solution on it. Or can you provide a guide/tutorial to connect 5800 with adhoc network and dialup internet in windows 7.</p>

<p>System: Windows 7 Dial up internet connection with ICS enabled. Ad-Hoc wireless network with WEP Nokia 5800 Xpress Music phonw</p>

<p>Note: I have read other posts also and tried their solutions but didnt worked for me. the first solution is to bridge the network and access it. but how can i bridge the dialup and wlan netwok? second solution is manually configure IP and DNS addresses in phone. But what should i add as IP and DNS as my dial up and adhoc network have automatic addresses.</p>
